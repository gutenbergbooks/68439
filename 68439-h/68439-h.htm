<p>A beautiful young widow, Mrs. Octavia Hathaway, with the
connivance of her admirer, Craven Black, succeeded in marrying
the wealthy widower, Sir Harold Wynde, who had a daughter,
Neva, at school in France, and a son, George, with his regiment
in India. A hurried call to the deathbed of his son frustrated
the design of the two adventurers to poison the baronet, who,
after his son died, was reported to have been killed by a tiger
in India, instead of which he was kept prisoner by a treacherous
native servant. After fifteen months of outward mourning
Lady Wynde married Craven Black, and in order to secure the
large fortune of her stepdaughter, she determined that Neva
should marry Black’s son, Rufus. The latter, however, although
in fear of his father, was not unscrupulous. He had married a
young girl named Lalla Bird, but as both were under age he
was persuaded that the marriage was illegal. Lalla was reported
to have thrown herself into the river on learning this, but
the body recovered was not hers. She found employment as
governess to the children of a Mrs. Blight. Rufus, believing
her dead, proposed to Neva, but was refused, and the young
heiress became betrothed to Lord Towyn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA’S ANSWER TO LORD TOWYN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black, summoning the indispensable
Mrs. Artress to a private conference, passed some
hours in their own room in anxious deliberation upon
their future course in regard to Neva. It was necessary
to the full success of the daring game they were playing,
that Neva should marry Rufus Black; but she had rejected
him, completely and finally, in obedience to her
instincts of duty to God and to herself, and her enemies
began to believe that they would have serious trouble
in forcing her into the marriage.</p>

<p>In accordance with the conclusion to which they
finally arrived, Mrs. Artress went away from Hawkhurst
that very afternoon in the family brougham, and two
trunks belonging to her were conveyed to Canterbury in
a spring wagon. It was given out that she was going
to London to visit a friend. She really went up to London,
but to what point she then directed her wanderings
no one knew.</p>

<p>Rufus Black wandered disconsolately all day in the
park, and came in an hour before dinner. His father
encountered him in the upper hall, and went into his
room with him.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine face, Rufus,” said Craven Black, sneeringly,<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
“to win the heart of a girl like Miss Wynde. You
look as if you were traveling straight to the dogs.”</p>

<p>“So I am, sir,” said Rufus, recklessly.</p>

<p>“You dare to answer me in that manner?”</p>

<p>“To whom should I tell the truth, if not to you?”
cried Rufus desperately. “You have made me what I
am. I married a pure and innocent young girl, who but
for me was utterly friendless in the wide world. You
tore me from her. You persuaded me that my marriage
was illegal—”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was, but it was not null and void. It
could have been set aside by due process of law, because
I was a minor, and because I perjured myself in declaring
that I was of age; but I refuse to believe that it was
null and void, no marriage at all. I never wronged my
poor Lally as you pretend.”</p>

<p>“Why this spasm of virtue?” demanded Craven Black,
with a cynical smile. “The girl’s dead, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s dead! God help me!”</p>

<p>“What a tragic groan! This morning you were in
despair because Miss Wynde rejected you. To-night
you are mourning after your corn-chandler’s daughter.
I’d like to understand you—I would indeed. Which are
you wailing after, Miss Wynde or Lalla Rookh?”</p>

<p>“Which?” cried Rufus, with wild eyes. “For the
girl you and I murdered! It is she whom I mourn! I
think of her stark form and open eyes and dead bruised
face, as she must have looked when they brought her up
out of the river, and my heart is like to break within
me. She haunts me day and night. In my bed I waken
from my dreams to clasp her closer to me, but my arms
close on the empty air. I seem to feel the touch of her
hands on my face—oh, Heaven! I shall never feel them
there again! I was a poor pitiful coward. Yet what<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
could I do? And yet you and I are Lally’s murderers!”</p>

<p>Craven Black shivered involuntarily.</p>

<p>“You act as if you had a touch of the D. T.” he said.
“Have you been spending the day in a Canterbury pot-house?”</p>

<p>“No; I have been wandering in the park, trying to forget.
You need not fear that I shall get drunk again.”</p>

<p>“Your reflections were rather singular for a rejected
lover of Miss Wynde,” sneered Craven Black. “I thought
you loved the heiress?”</p>

<p>“So I do, but not as I loved Lally. If Miss Wynde
does not take pity on me, I am lost. The love of a good
woman would save me from madness and utter despair.
In time I might grow to love her as I loved Lally, and
in any case I would worship her from very gratitude.”</p>

<p>“I am blessed if I can understand you,” said Craven
Black, his lips curling. “You love a dead woman and
a living woman, and mourn one while you want to marry
the other. It is very curious. It’s a pity you are not a
Mahommedan, so that you could have had both.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Rufus, in a tone of command. “Don’t
speak such words in connection with the names of Lally
and Miss Wynde. I want to marry Neva to save myself
from going mad—”</p>

<p>“After another woman? Exactly. No wonder Miss
Wynde declined the honor, with thanks.”</p>

<p>“I shall leave here to-morrow,” said Rufus.</p>

<p>“You won’t do any such thing. You will stay at
Hawkhurst for the remainder of the week, and play the
lover to Miss Wynde, and sigh like any donkey in her
ears, and spout poetry, and touch her heart. ‘Faint
heart never won fair lady,’ says the proverb. Girls often
refuse a man the first time he offers, for fear of being<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
held too cheap. Pursue the girl gently, but keep pursuing.”</p>

<p>“She says her father wrote her a letter saying he knew
me,” said Rufus doggedly. “She asked me about him,
and I told her I didn’t know Sir Harold from a butcher.”</p>

<p>“You did?” gasped Craven Black. “The devil!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have put your foot in it. I knew you were
a fool, but I didn’t suppose you had arrived at such a low
state of idiocy as it appears you have. Didn’t I tell you
what to tell the girl if she ever spoke of her father?”</p>

<p>“I believe you did, but I couldn’t stand there with
her eyes on me and deliberately lie to her. I understood
about the letter. <em>You</em> wrote it.”</p>

<p>“Hush! I’ve a good mind to leave you to yourself,
and let you fetch up in some union,” declared Craven
Black angrily. “Such a dolt as you are isn’t fit to live.
How do you expect the girl to marry you when you
yourself put obstacles in the way?”</p>

<p>“See here,” said Rufus. “What are you going to
make out of my marriage with Neva Wynde?”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pounds a year, which you are to formally
agree to pay me out of her income.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had some motive in the matter besides
love to me. But I’d pay it if she’d marry me. But she
won’t.”</p>

<p>“She will, if you choose to be a little bolder. We
leave here, my wife, Neva and myself, next Monday for
Wynde Heights. Mrs. Black will use all her influence
with Neva during our absence to induce her to accept
you, and I am sure she will succeed. You are to hold
yourself in readiness to come to us at any moment on
receiving my summons.”</p>

<p>“Where is Wynde Heights?”</p>

<p>“In Yorkshire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>“Very well. I will come when you notify me. But I
don’t think going will do any good. Miss Wynde is no
coquette, and not likely to change her mind. Besides,
she is likely to marry Lord Towyn.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Craven Black significantly. “She
is a minor, and I don’t believe she would marry against
the wishes of her step-mother?”</p>

<p>“The question is if your wife <em>is</em> her step-mother,” remarked
Rufus, still recklessly. “The probability is that
the relationship is worn out by this time, and the sense
of duty that Miss Wynde may have felt toward her father’s
widow will fall short when it comes to be directed
toward Craven Black’s wife.”</p>

<p>“We won’t go into details,” said his father coolly. “If
you want to marry the girl, keep telling her so. There’s
nothing like persistence.”</p>

<p>“Ye-s; but about that ten thousand pounds a year?”
said Rufus thoughtfully. “I don’t think it would be
right to take any such sum out of her income, and besides,
it might be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me. As to the right and wrong of it,
a perjurer is not qualified to judge. Confine yourself
to what you can understand. It is time to get ready
for dinner, and I advise you to come down with a cheerful
face.”</p>

<p>With this advice, Craven Black went away to his own
rooms.</p>

<p>Rufus resolved to act upon his father’s advice, and
when he went down to dinner with a pale, melancholy
face, and haggard eyes, he wore an air of assumed
cheerfulness which touched Neva’s heart.</p>

<p>That evening he sang with her while she played upon
the piano. He quoted poetry to her in the third drawing-room,
where they were alone, and afterward induced<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
her to walk with him in the moonlight upon the
terrace.</p>

<p>The next day he was full of delicate attentions to
Miss Wynde. She found a bouquet of wood violets at
her plate at breakfast, with the dew still upon them,
and knew who had procured them for her. He asked
to be allowed to accompany her on her morning ride,
and Neva assented. After the ride, they played chess,
gathered bouquets in the conservatory, and, later,
walked in the park. Neva was gently courteous to him
all the while, but there was a quiet reserve in her manner
that forbade him to speak again of love or marriage
to her.</p>

<p>The day after Lord Towyn called at Hawkhurst, and
Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black received him with all courtesy,
and were so politely attentive to him that he could
not exchange a word with Neva unheard by them.</p>

<p>The young earl went away, as may be supposed,
troubled and annoyed.</p>

<p>On Friday he rode over again from his marine villa,
and was similarly entertained, and again could not see
Neva alone.</p>

<p>On Saturday he came to Hawkhurst in the early
morning, and learned at the lodge gate that Miss
Wynde, attended by her groom, was gone for a ride, and
that she had gone by the Dingle Farm. His heart
bounded within him, and he spurred away in eager pursuit.</p>

<p>He traversed the wood and crossed the wide common,
and skirted the dangerous chalk pit, and rode up to the
old farm gate just as Neva, remounting her horse, came
riding out on her return.</p>

<p>The young earl’s warm blue eyes flashed a tender
radiance upon her, and he raised his hat, his golden hair
gleaming in the sunshine while his noble face glowed<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
with a laughing delight. An answering radiance flashed
from Neva’s red-brown orbs, and she blushed as she
bade him a careless good-morning.</p>

<p>“I came out to meet you,” said Lord Towyn, as he
wheeled his horse and rode at her side.</p>

<p>“I have much to say to you.”</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder, but the discreet groom
was hanging back, and with a mental blessing upon the
fellow, Lord Towyn saw that the field was clear, and
that the time had arrived in which to learn his fate.</p>

<p>They rode on for a little while in silence, until they
were past the chalk pit and out upon the breezy common.
The groom was out of earshot, and the young
earl said gently:</p>

<p>“Neva, I have been twice to Hawkhurst to receive
the answer you promised me, but I could not speak to
you alone. I may not find another opportunity than
this, as you go with the Blacks to Wynde Heights on
Monday. And so, although this does not seem a fitting
place, I ask you again if you will be my wife. I love
you, Neva, with all my heart and soul. If you will
trust your happiness to me, you will find in me a true
lover to the end of our days. Do you think you could
be happy with me?”</p>

<p>Neva’s pure proud face flushed hotly, and she bent her
head low toward her saddle-bow. Lord Towyn waited
for her answer in an almost breathless suspense, but she
did not speak until they were in the wood path and out
of sight of even the lagging groom.</p>

<p>Then she lifted her head shyly, and turned upon her
lover a face as divinely fair and roseate as a June morning,
and although she spoke no word he read assent in
the drooping eyes, the reddening cheeks, and the proud,
tremulous mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>He pressed toward her in rapture, and seized one
little gauntleted hand, pressing it in his own.</p>

<p>“It is Yes, Neva?” he whispered, as if fearing the very
birds might hear him. “Oh, my darling, how shall I
deserve this great joy?”</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips, and the contact
thrilled his very soul. He looked back. No one was in
sight. He stooped in his saddle and bent toward her,
and his kiss, warm, tender and passionate, fell upon her
scarlet mouth, and thus they were betrothed.</p>

<p>The next instant he was again erect in his saddle, and
the ecstasy of his glowing face and the unrepressed rapture
of his manner, and the tender caressing in his very
gaze, proclaimed his great and solemn joy.</p>

<p>“I have a ring, it was my mother’s, Neva, and I ask
you to wear it as a sign of our engagement to each
other,” he said. “When I see my mother’s ring on your
finger, I shall feel that you are indeed mine.”</p>

<p>He took from his little finger a gold ring set with a
single brilliant of great size and splendor. Neva tremblingly
removed her gauntlet, and the young earl placed
the ring upon that finger which custom has dedicated to
the purpose.</p>

<p>“That is the seal of our betrothal,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Neva slowly put on her glove.</p>

<p>“Arthur,” she said suddenly, “do you think papa
would have approved my marriage with you?”</p>

<p>“I know he would, my darling. It was his wish, as it
was my father’s, that we should marry.”</p>

<p>“If I could only think that he never changed his
mind!” sighed the young girl. “I have a letter he
wrote me the night before he perished in India, Arthur,
and in this letter he says that he desires me to marry
Rufus Black.”</p>

<p>The young earl looked surprised, incredulous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“I have the letter with me,” said Neva. “You can read
it. In it papa says he desires me to marry this young
man, whom he esteems and loves. I have struggled to
obey papa’s last wishes, but I cannot—I cannot! And
he was such a good father, Arthur, that I reproach myself
continually for my disobedience. I never disobeyed
him before, and I seem to see his eyes full of reproach
fixed upon me, and to hear his voice—Oh, Arthur!
Arthur!”</p>

<p>“Let me see the letter, darling.”</p>

<p>Neva extricated it from the folds of her dress, and
gave it to him. They halted while he read it. A look
of surprise, wonder and incredulity mantled Lord
Towyn’s face as he read. It was followed by a sternness
that well became his fair and haughty face.</p>

<p>“I pronounce the letter a forgery!” he declared.
“May I keep it, Neva, for the present? I desire to show
it to Mr. Atkins, who shall give us his opinion on the
handwriting.”</p>

<p>“Yes; keep it,” assented Neva.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn carefully put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I pronounce the letter a forgery,” he repeated sternly.
“How did it come to you, darling?”</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde gave it to me on my return from
France. Papa desired her to retain it for a year. Who
would forge such a letter, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I am puzzled. One cannot suspect
Lady Wynde, and yet—and yet—I don’t know what to
think, Neva. I don’t believe Sir Harold ever saw Rufus
Black.”</p>

<p>“Rufus says he never saw papa, or that he never
spoke to him,” said Neva. “And that remark made me
doubt the letter. But Rufus never forged it, Arthur.
Rufus is a kind-hearted, but weak-willed boy—he is no
more. If he had more ‘backbone’ in his character, he<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
would be even noble. I like him, Arthur, and I know
he never wrote that letter. Lady Wynde did not. She
is too good for that. It might have been written by
Craven Black. I do not like him, and think him quite
capable of the forgery, only so many of the words are
papa’s own that it seems wicked to doubt its authenticity.”</p>

<p>“I will prove it a forgery!” cried the young earl.
“Sir Harold was incapable of binding your fate in this
manner to a man you never saw before it was written.
There is some foul conspiracy against you, Neva, but
we have outwitted your enemies. I am impatient to
have you under my own guardianship. The possibility
that you have enemies makes me afraid to trust you
from me. Give up this visit to Wynde Heights, darling.”</p>

<p>“It is too late, Arthur. We shall stay there but a
fortnight, and I have promised to go. Papa bade me
love his wife and obey her, and though she no longer
bears his name, and I no longer owe her obedience, yet
I have given my word to go up to Yorkshire with her,
and must keep my promise.”</p>

<p>“But when you return, Neva, you will marry me?
Do not condemn me to a long probation. Let us be
married quietly some morning at Wyndham church,
after due intimation to our friends. Shall it not be so?”</p>

<p>Neva yielded a shy assent.</p>

<p>“We will be married a month hence, Neva?” whispered
the ardent young lover.</p>

<p>“Two months,” said Neva, smiling. “I must not be
too lightly won, Lord Towyn. And, besides, I must
have the orthodox trousseau. I will tell Mrs. Black of
our engagement when I am with her at Wynde Heights.
Rufus is not going with us, nor is Artress.”</p>

<p>They had threaded the wood and come out upon the<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
highway long since while they were talking, and were
now within sight of Hawkhurst. Rufus Black was
riding out of the great gates, on his way to meet Neva.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tete-a-tete</i> of the young pair was over for the morning,
and recognizing the fact, and not wishing to proclaim
his happy secret to his defeated rival, Lord Towyn
made his adieus to Neva, begging her to write him daily
from Yorkshire, which she promised to do, and, then
raising his hat to Rufus Black, the young earl spurred
his horse and rode swiftly on toward Wyndham.</p>

<p>Neva returned home with Rufus.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black,
accompanied by Miss Wynde, departed for Wynde
Heights.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Lord Towyn looked for a letter from
his young betrothed. None came. Thursday, Friday
and Saturday went by, and still there came no letter
from Neva, announcing her safe arrival in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The young earl wrote every day, his uneasiness increasing
as the time passed. He communicated his
alarm to Sir John Freise and Mr. Atkins, and they telegraphed
to the clergyman of the little town in whose
vicinity Wynde Heights was situated, begging him to
call and see if Miss Wynde was in good health.</p>

<p>The answer to this dispatch came promptly, and also
by telegraph. It was to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir John Freise and Mr. Atkins: Wynde Heights is
untenanted, save by the housekeeper. Miss Wynde has
not been here, nor have Mr. and Mrs. Black.”</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt of this astounding message, the young earl
posted up to town, as did Sir John Freise and Mr. Atkins.
They searched for the missing heiress and her
guardians, but their search was futile. Not a trace of
her could be found. She had come up to London with<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
her enemies, but no further clue to her could be found.
She had completely disappeared, and her fate was
shrouded in dark and horrible mystery!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE PUZZLE OF NEVA’S WHEREABOUTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On going up to town with Sir John Freise and Mr.
Atkins to engage in the search for Neva Wynde, who
had so strangely and mysteriously disappeared, Lord
Towyn had left orders with the steward of his marine
villa to forward to him in London without delay any
and all letters that might arrive to the address of the
young earl. And so, while he prosecuted his researches
with desperate energy, Lord Towyn half expected by
every post some news from his young betrothed.</p>

<p>The three guardians of Neva’s estate were sadly puzzled
and thoroughly alarmed, but for Neva’s own sake
they kept the mystery to themselves. Mr. Atkins urged
that no detectives be taken into their confidence, and
that no newspapers be permitted to publish the strange
story.</p>

<p>“We shall do as well as any detectives,” said the
attorney, “and if there is any game afoot, we will not
set the villains who are at work in it upon their guard.”</p>

<p>“Villains?” echoed Sir John Freise disapprovingly.
“The thing is mysterious, Mr. Atkins, but it is susceptible
of explanation. Had it not been for Miss Wynde’s
promise to write daily to Lord Towyn, and her failure
to comply with that promise, we should have suspected
no harm. ‘Villains’ is a strong word to apply to Miss<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
Wynde’s companions. Miss Wynde may have fallen ill
on the way to Wynde Heights, or the plan of the tour
may have been changed. In fact, one of these alternatives
doubtless contains the truth. But ‘villains,’ Mr.
Atkins—the word troubles me. To whom do you apply
it? Certainly not to the beautiful lady who was the
wife of our friend Sir Harold Wynde, and who was so
loved and trusted by him that he constituted her the
sole personal guardian of his beloved daughter?”</p>

<p>“And who so appreciated her husband’s love and
noble qualities,” said Mr. Atkins dryly, “that in one
year from his tragic death she was receiving the loving
attentions of a Craven Black, and in fifteen months after
Sir Harold’s death became the wife of a Craven Black!
Bah! I was never deceived in Lady Wynde, not even
when Sir Harold brought her home to Hawkhurst. She
is a bold, designing, unscrupulous creature, and it is as
well that Sir Harold died before she broke his heart.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Atkins, your harsh judgment amazes me—”</p>

<p>“I imagine, Sir John Freise,” said the attorney, “that
in your secret soul your opinion of Mrs. Craven Black
is much higher than mine. Have you been blind to the
insatiable vanity, and the vulgarity and ill-taste of the
widow of Sir Harold Wynde, who, fifteen months after
losing the noblest husband the sun ever shone on, converts
that husband’s house into a ball-room, and sets his
church bells ringing and his tenantry dancing at her
marriage with a gambler and adventurer, unworthy even
to breathe the same air with Sir Harold’s pure young
daughter? You look shocked, Sir John. If it were necessary,
I could give you my further opinion concerning
Mrs. Craven Black, but you are sufficiently shocked
already.”</p>

<p>“You said, Mr. Atkins,” said Lord Towyn, “that you
thought Mrs. Black unscrupulous. I cannot believe her<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
as base as you think, but I have a question to submit to
you and Sir John. When I asked Miss Wynde to become
my wife, she told me that it had been her father’s last
wish that she should marry Rufus Black—”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Sir John and Mr. Atkins, in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde showed me a letter purporting to have
been written by Sir Harold the night before his sudden
death,” said Lord Towyn. “I have the letter with me,
and a study of it may throw light upon a matter that
certainly looks dark to me. I could almost make oath
that the deceased baronet never wrote this letter. It deceived
Neva completely, if it prove, as I have declared
it, a forgery.”</p>

<p>He produced the letter, and gave it into the hands of
Mr. Atkins. The attorney read it aloud, weighing each
phrase and turn of sentence.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold wrote it,” declared Sir John Freise, without
hesitation. “I have heard him express himself in
those quaint, oddly turned sentences a hundred times.
Those pet names for his daughter, so tender and poetical,
were surely written by him. Miss Wynde accepted
the letter as genuine, and I do the same without
question.”</p>

<p>“And you, my lord?” inquired Atkins.</p>

<p>“It seems to me a forgery,” said Lord Towyn.
“Rufus Black confessed to Neva that he had had no personal
acquaintance with Sir Harold Wynde.”</p>

<p>“That is odd,” declared Sir John, puzzled. “Perhaps
Sir Harold was not quite in his right mind when he wrote
the letter. His presentiment of approaching death may
have unsettled his judgment; but that is preposterous.
I can’t explain the incongruities, but I persist in my
opinion that Sir Harold Wynde wrote the letter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>“What is your opinion, Mr. Atkins?” demanded Lord
Towyn.</p>

<p>“Where is Rufus Black?” asked the lawyer abruptly.</p>

<p>“Down at Hawkhurst. He remains there during the
absence of the bridal party,” answered the young earl in
surprise.</p>

<p>“And Rufus Black has confessed to Miss Wynde that
he was not personally acquainted with Sir Harold
Wynde?” mused the attorney. “My opinion about
young Black is, that he is a well-meaning but weak-souled
lad, just the person to be made a dupe or instrument
in the hands of more unscrupulous and daring
souls. I don’t dislike the boy. If he were his own
master, or had a different father, he’d be a decent fellow.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of his father, Atkins?” inquired
Sir John.</p>

<p>“I think he’s a villain.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of this letter, Atkins?” asked
Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Atkins quietly, “that it is a forgery.
More, I know that it is a forgery. Sir Harold Wynde
was too tender a father to attempt to control his daughter’s
choice of a husband in a manner so singular. The
truth is, Craven Black has begun some sort of game
against the Wyndes, and if it don’t date further back
than Sir Harold’s death, I am mistaken. I see you look
distressed, Sir John, so I will keep my ideas to myself
until I can prove their value. Lord Towyn, will you
allow me to retain this letter for the present, to study at
my leisure?”</p>

<p>The young earl assented, and Atkins secured the letter
on his person.</p>

<p>“And now what are we to do?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p>“I shall take a turn up into Yorkshire, and have a look<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
at Wynde Heights for myself,” said Atkins. “You had
better remain here, Sir John, and not expose yourself to
useless fatigue.”</p>

<p>“I shall go with you, Atkins,” declared the young
earl.</p>

<p>Sir John Freise was anxious to accompany them, but
he was scarcely able to bear the fatigue of so hurried a
journey, and permitted himself to be overruled. He
agreed to remain at their hotel, the Langham, until the
return of his friends from the north, and that very
evening Lord Towyn and Mr. Atkins departed for
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>They arrived in due time at Wynde Heights, a lofty
hill, crowned with a beautiful, wide spreading villa, built
after the Italian style, and having long colonades. There
were ample grounds attached to the villa, a hundred
acres or more in extent. Lord Towyn and Mr. Atkins
drove out to the place in a cab, and alighting at the carriage
porch rang loudly for admittance.</p>

<p>An old housekeeper, a Yorkshire woman, with a broad
face and quiet manners, and with but little of the usual
Yorkshire burr in her speech, opened the door cautiously
after a long delay, and peeped out at them with apparent
timidity.</p>

<p>“How do you do, ma’am?” said the lawyer, raising
his hat to her respectfully. “We have called to see Miss
Wynde and Mrs. Craven Black.”</p>

<p>“The leddies are not here, sir,” answered the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Not here!” exclaimed Atkins. “But Mrs. Black
said they were coming here.”</p>

<p>“Her leddyship wrote to me to have the house ready
for her, after her new marriage,” said the housekeeper,
“and to engage servants, which I did. And about two
weeks ago I got a letter from her leddyship, telling me<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
to dismiss the servants and shut up the house, as her
leddyship had decided not to come to the Heights, and
I obeyed orders.”</p>

<p>“Will you show us that letter?” demanded the lawyer.
“We are the guardians of Miss Wynde’s estate, and find
it necessary to see the young lady at the earliest possible
moment. We expected to find her here, but the letter
may afford us some clue to her whereabouts. This gentleman
is Lord Towyn, and I am William Atkins, the
attorney of the Wynde family.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper threw wide open the door of the
house. Both names were familiar to her, and she welcomed
the visitors as those having a right to the hospitalities
of the place.</p>

<p>“Come in, my lord; come in, sir,” she exclaimed. “I
will get the letter for you.”</p>

<p>The visitors followed her into a cool, unused parlor,
and seated themselves, while the woman hurried away in
quest of the letter of which she had spoken.</p>

<p>“I had an idea that the Blacks might be stopping here
secretly,” said Atkins, in a low voice; “but I’ve changed
my mind, my lord. They have not been here. The
housekeeper’s face is honesty itself. We’ll have to look
elsewhere. I’m sorry we’ve wasted time on the wrong
tack.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper reappeared with the letter. Lord
Towyn and Mr. Atkins read it. It had been written by
Mrs. Craven Black, and was to the effect that she had
changed her mind, and that the bridal party would not
come north that season, and ordering the newly engaged
servants to be dismissed, and the house to be again
closed.</p>

<p>Atkins sighed, as he restored the letter to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“We are much obliged to you ma’am,” he said, “and<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
now we must hasten back to London. If you hear from
your mistress, be kind enough to drop me a line at my
address. There’s my card. But it’s not likely you will
hear from Mrs. Black before we do.”</p>

<p>The visitors bade the housekeeper good morning, and
hurried back to the railway station in their cab, catching
the down train, and speeding on their way to London.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe our party is in England,” said Atkins
musingly, as they steamed swiftly down the line to the
southward. “It would be like the Blacks, if they had
any game afoot, to make for the Continent. Our next
point is to make inquiries at the docks, or at the railway
stations.”</p>

<p>They arrived in London in the morning, and hastened
to the Langham hotel, where they had an interview with
Sir John Freise, who was looking worn and ill under all
this suspense and anxiety. The three gentlemen devoted
the day to visiting the various railway stations
and offices of the Continental boats. They visited also
the foreign packet-boats lying in dock, and toward evening
learned from the steward of an Ostend boat, that a
party such as was described, consisting of two ladies
and one gentleman, had crossed the Channel to Ostend
at about the time indicated by Atkins.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! We are on the track!” breathed
Sir John.</p>

<p>“Atkins and I will start for Ostend by way of Dover
this very night,” said Lord Towyn, all ardor and impatience.</p>

<p>Atkins drew out a golden sovereign, which he held
tantalizingly before the eyes of the steward.</p>

<p>“Answer a few more questions,” said the attorney,
“and this is yours, my good fellow. Describe the gentleman
who accompanied the two ladies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>The steward hesitated, eyeing the coin with greedy
eyes.</p>

<p>“He was tall and fair, with mustaches,” he said slowly,
as if fearing the description would not suit his interlocutor,
“and he was dressed in black.”</p>

<p>“That would describe Craven Black well enough,”
murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>“And the ladies?” questioned Atkins. “How did
they look?”</p>

<p>“One was some years older than the other, and was
dark, with black eyes. The young lady had lighter
hair. They were going on to Brussels, and I took it
that the elder lady and gentleman were newly married,”
said the steward, “they were that sickish, begging your
pardon.”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt we are on the right track,” cried
Sir John, in a tone of relief.</p>

<p>Atkins paid the steward the promised sovereign, and
led the way ashore and to the waiting cab.</p>

<p>“To the hotel,” he ordered.</p>

<p>The gentlemen entered the vehicle and hastened back
to the Langham. Atkins was very thoughtful and
silent during the journey, but as they drove up to the
hotel he said:</p>

<p>“We are tired Lord Towyn, and must have rest. I
propose that we sleep here to-night, and go on to Dover
and Ostend in the morning. I know how anxious and
impatient you are, but we must not overtask our
strength. You look quite worn out.”</p>

<p>“It is with anxiety then,” said the young earl. “I
am eager to go on, Mr. Atkins, but will wait till morning
as you counsel.”</p>

<p>The three gentlemen ascended to their private parlor
which they shared in common. As they entered the
room, a man who was standing at one of the windows,<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
looking out, turned and came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>He was the steward of Lord Towyn’s marine place.</p>

<p>“You here, Sewel?” exclaimed the young earl. “Is
anything the matter?”</p>

<p>The steward, an elderly man, with a rugged countenance,
as gnarled as an old oak, yet full of kindly
warmth, shook his head as he answered:</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong, my lord; but you ordered
any letters to be sent to you, and knowing how anxious
you were, I feared the letter might miscarry, and here it
is. I brought it myself.”</p>

<p>“A letter!” cried the three gentlemen in chorus, having
no thought of any letter save the one they so much
desired.</p>

<p>“It’s in a lady’s hand, and that’s why I brought it,”
said the steward.</p>

<p>He took out his pocket-book and drew from it a small
square envelope, daintily addressed and sealed.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn uttered a cry of joy, recognizing the
handwriting at once.</p>

<p>“It is from Neva!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>He hurried with it to a window, turning his back on
his friends, and tore open the envelope, disclosing a four-page
letter, signed with the name of Neva Wynde.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried aloud. “It is dated Brussels.”</p>

<p>“We were on the right track then,” said Atkins exultantly.</p>

<p>The young earl perused his letter with a glad heart.</p>

<p>It was very tender and very sweet, full of delicate
allusions to their betrothal, and was indeed such a letter
as only a woman could write, yet the young lover was
not satisfied. The letter lacked the straightforward
simplicity that distinguished Neva, and it seemed to
Lord Towyn to lack also sincerity. It had been written
from the head rather than from the heart, and his first<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
great joy and gladness gave way to a sudden and terrible
sense of disappointment.</p>

<p>The steward, seeing that he was not wanted, went
quietly from the room, intent upon securing his dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins and Sir John Freise approached our hero,
and the baronet laid a kindly hand upon the young earl’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Forgive us for interrupting your happy reverie, Lord
Towyn,” he said, “but we are very anxious. Miss
Wynde writes from Brussels, and in good spirits? We
have been troubling ourselves for nothing?”</p>

<p>The young earl did not look around, nor did he speak.
He only clutched the letter tighter in his fingers.</p>

<p>“We have got into a panic for nothing,” said Atkins,
smiling. “We will keep the joke to ourselves. I would
not have Mr. Black curling his cynical lips over our folly,
not for worlds. No doubt Miss Wynde satisfactorily
explains her previous silence, my lord, and we are free
to return home again, wiser if not better men?”</p>

<p>The young earl turned to his companions now, and
they started when they saw how deadly pale he was, and
what a look of terror and anguish gleamed from his warm
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde is not ill?” cried Sir John.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn raised his arm, waving the letter in the
air.</p>

<p>“This letter is in Neva’s handwriting, and signed with
her name,” he said, in a strained voice. “It purports
to come from her, but, before God, I believe it to be a
forgery! My instinct tells me that Neva never wrote
it. We are upon the wrong track. Neva is not at Brussels.
Perhaps she is not out of England. She is in the
hands of her enemies, who have formed some foul conspiracy
against her, and we, O God! are powerless to
save her!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN ADVERTISEMENT QUICKLY ANSWERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the hour drew near for the arrival of the expected
guest at Sandy Lands, a suppressed excitement pervaded
the pert little villa from basement to attic. The servants
had all received orders to wait upon Mrs. Wroat with the
utmost alacrity, and some notion of her wealth and eccentricity
had been conveyed to them, together with the idea
that Mr. and Mrs. Blight entertained “expectations” of
inheriting the old lady’s fortune at her death.</p>

<p>Mr. Blight had remained at home upon this day, in
order that his aunt-in-law might not conceive herself
neglected by him. He was dressed in his Sunday garments,
and was practising a smile of welcome, which
had somewhat a sickly look, contrasted as it was with
his anxious eyes, and uneasy, apprehensive manner.</p>

<p>“Everything hangs upon this visit,” he muttered to
himself, as he stood at the parlor window, watching the
road. “The old creature is a bundle of whims and
caprices, and if she should leave her money to a charity
we are undone. Our expenses are so heavy that I can
no longer meet them. The old woman <em>must</em> make her
will in my favor!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight had attired herself in a tightly fitting
gown of red silk, through which her rotund figure
threatened to burst at any moment, and she wore a massive
gold chain, a necklace, bracelets and brooch, so that
she might have personated at a fancy ball the character
of an animated jeweller’s shop.</p>

<p>“What have you got on all that jewelry for?” demanded
Mr. Blight, glancing at his wife, as she complacently<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
surveyed the reflection of her stout person and
flushed face in the long mirror.</p>

<p>“Why?” said Mrs. Blight, with a degree of worldly
wisdom for which her husband, it is to be feared, had
never given her credit, “there’s nothing like making the
old woman think we are prosperous. Money brings
money. If Aunt Wroat sees us haggling about the
butcher’s bills and the school bills, she may think her
money is going into a bottomless bucket. But if she
sees us apparently rich, and without money cares, she
will be more anxious to leave her money to us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Mr. Blight. “I wish she’d come.
Upon my soul, I do. Why didn’t my uncle leave me his
money, and give his wife an annuity? In that case, I
shouldn’t have cared what became of her, and I certainly
would not have been dancing attendance upon her. All
our care,” he added sourly, “and all our flattery will go
for nothing if the children are not kept out of the way.
And there the young savages come pellmell down the
stairs.”</p>

<p>“The ‘young savages!’” moaned Mrs. Blight, in terrible
reproach. “Have you the soul of a father? Can
you call your own offspring savages, as if they were the
children of a red Indian, or of cannibals? I’ll send the
poor dears back to the school-room. Between you and
your horrible old aunt, the poor darlings are in terror of
their lives.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight hastened out into the hall, but it was now
empty. The young governess and the nurse had captured
all of the refractory brood save Leopold, and had
conveyed them back to the school-room. Leopold had
made good his escape into the garden, and was now
careering about like a young colt, shouting at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight, hearing the noise made by her offspring,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
was full of terror lest her guest should arrive, and encounter
the terrible infant at the gate of Sandy Lands.
She rang the bell violently, and ordered Miss Bird to
take charge of her pupil immediately. Lally descended
to the garden to obey this command, and at the very
moment when he chose to yield to her persuasions and
be led away captive, a heavily laden cab drove up to the
garden door, and the garden bell was rung violently.</p>

<p>The smart housemaid hastened to give admittance to
the visitor, and the youthful Leopold, greatly excited at
the prospect of seeing Mrs. Wroat, whom he detested,
but cordially loved to annoy, struggled in Lally’s grasp.
The young girl drew her charge into the shadow of a
clump of trees, and stood there, panting and flushed,
just as the visitor’s luggage was brought in in advance
of the visitor herself.</p>

<p>First came three large trunks, a bandbox in a green
cotton bag, a parrot in a cage, who croaked and chattered
and muttered hoarse threats, and a blue silk family
umbrella.</p>

<p>And then followed the queerest old lady Lally had
ever seen. She leaned upon the arm of a tall, angular,
hatchet-faced woman, her maid and constant attendant,
who spoke to her mistress with a loving gentleness
a mother might exhibit toward her child, but which
sounded strangely from her thin, compressed lips, and
who guided the faltering steps of her mistress with the
tenderest care.</p>

<p>It was the old lady, however, upon whom Lally’s gaze
was fixed with strange intensity. She was thin and
withered and bent, a mere wreck of a woman who had
been in her day handsome, graceful and spirited. She
was nearly eighty years of age, and her hands, incased
in black knitted mittens, through whose open meshes
her bony fingers showed, clasped a gold-headed staff,<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
which partially supported her, the maid giving her an
arm.</p>

<p>The old lady wore an old-fashioned brocade gown, a
big traveling cloak, a white frilled cap, and a huge scuttle-shaped
bonnet, such as had been worn in her early
prime. But her eyes were black and keen and penetrating,
full of sparkle and brightness; her hooked nose
was prominent like an eagle’s beak; and her mouth was
curled habitually in a strangely cynical smile or sneer.</p>

<p>The old lady gave a quizzical glance up at the doorway,
in which stood Mr. and Mrs. Blight with outstretched
arms, and then looked toward Lally. The
young girl shrank back, and hurried in at the rear porch
and up stairs with her young charge, just as Mrs. Wroat
came in at the front door and was received by her connections
with loud exclamations of welcome.</p>

<p>The visitor was installed in her own apartments, and
she did not emerge from them for the remainder of the
day. Mr. Blight went to his office. A supernatural stillness
reigned throughout the villa. Mrs. Wroat chose to
appear at dinner, which was served at Sandy Lands at
seven o’clock; and Mr. Blight was then at home to give
her his arm into the dining-room, and to pay her all
necessary attentions.</p>

<p>She looked, as Mrs. Blight privately remarked to her
husband, “like a witch of Endor,” in her dinner costume
of black velvet, with a scarlet velvet circular cloak
thrown about her thin bent figure, and with her keen
black eyes peering sharply out of her sallow face. She
only needed a scarlet hood over her gray, wild looking
hair, to complete her resemblance to one of the witches
who are fabled to meet in lonely wood at midnight, to
stir devilish messes in boiling caldrons. But then she
wore a set of very fine diamonds, and even a “witch of<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
Endor,” with diamonds, would have been handsomely
treated by Mrs. Blight.</p>

<p>The old lady was not as courteous as a female Chesterfield.
In fact she snapped out spiteful remarks with
the utmost unconsciousness of the rising anger of host
or hostess, taking a malicious pleasure in stirring up
their evil passions, knowing that they dared not give
vent to them. It may be that she comprehended their
time-serving, speculating natures, and realized that they
paid court to her only for her money.</p>

<p>“Miserable wine!” she commented, with a wry face,
as she set down her glass. “Gladstone, isn’t it,
Charles? It comes at four and six the dozen bottles,
I believe. I never buy it myself. I prefer to take wormwood
and vitriol undiluted.”</p>

<p>The lawyer flushed. He prided himself on being a
connoisseur of wines, and having the choicest cellar in
Canterbury.</p>

<p>“That’s real port, Aunt Wroat,” he exclaimed—“of
the vintage of ’42.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they told you that, did they?” asked the old
lady. “These cheap wine dealers are up to all sorts of
tricks. I am surprised that you should have been taken
in so, nephew Charles. At your time of life a man should
have some judgment of his own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blight bit his lips furiously, and his wife fancied
she heard the old lady chuckle softly to herself, but a
glance at her did not confirm the impression.</p>

<p>Presently the old lady opened an attack upon the
lawyer’s wife. She looked at her though a quizzing-glass,
and exclaimed suddenly, with apparent astonishment:</p>

<p>“Laura, do you think it good taste to wear all that
Brummagem? If I could not get real gold, I wouldn’t
put on servant’s ornaments; I wouldn’t indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“But these are real gold, Aunt Wroat,” said Mrs. Blight,
her voice trembling with annoyance.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said the old lady severely. “Don’t contradict
me. I have been used to good jewelry all my
life, and ought to know it when I see it. Good gold!
Ha, ha! If you don’t know good gold, ask your cook.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight nearly choked with rage, and sulked during
the remainder of the dinner, or until her husband
threw her a warning glance that reminded her that she
could not afford to quarrel with their eccentric relative.</p>

<p>Several times during the repast the host and hostess
were stirred to anger they dared not exhibit, and several
times Mrs. Blight fancied she heard the old lady chuckle
to herself, but of this she could not be quite sure. The
Blights fawned upon their wealthy guest, swallowed her
insults, and smiled distractedly at her deadliest thrusts.
But both drew a sigh of relief when the old lady had
been carried back into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“May be she’ll go to her room now?” whispered Mrs.
Blight to her husband, as the old lady fanned herself
vigorously, and appeared oblivious of their existence.</p>

<p>“No such good luck,” returned the lawyer ill-naturedly.
“She ought to be shut up in a lunatic asylum,
the old nuisance. If it wasn’t for her money, she might
die in an alms-house before I’d give her shelter.”</p>

<p>The whisper was not low, but then Mrs. Wroat was
supposed to be “as deaf as a post,” and of course she
could not hear a sound so faint and indistinct. Mr. and
Mrs. Blight had frequently vented their opinions much
more loudly before her. But there was an odd snap in
her eyes on this occasion, as they thus whispered to each
other, and again Mrs. Blight fancied she heard a malicious
chuckle, but the old lady fell to coughing in a frightful
manner, and the lawyer’s wife had no time for fancies,
believing the old lady likely to die on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>When the paroxysm was over, and Mrs. Wroat began
to breathe freely, Mrs. Blight said, not without nervousness:</p>

<p>“You have a terrible cold, Aunt Wroat. Don’t you do
anything for it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a cold that’ll last me my days,” said Mrs. Wroat.
“It’s consumption.”</p>

<p>“Do you employ a doctor for it?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Death is the best doctor,” answered the old lady,
with grim facetiousness. “He’ll cure it for nothing.
This is my last visit to you, Charles. I sha’n’t last much
longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you will live twenty years yet, and visit
us every year!” cried Mrs. Blight. “Dear Aunt Wroat,
we love to have you with us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” said Mrs. Wroat, with another odd
snap in her witch-like eyes. “I know it, my dear. It’s
time to settle my affairs. I am thinking of making my
will soon.”</p>

<p>The Blights tried to look unconcerned, but failed.
Their curiosity and anxiety displayed themselves in
their features.</p>

<p>“Shall you leave your money to a charity, dear Aunt
Wroat?” inquired Mrs. Blight caressingly.</p>

<p>“No, no! I shall leave it to—But don’t ask me.
You’ll know in good time.”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked significantly at his wife.</p>

<p>“She means to leave it to us!” he whispered. “The
old nuisance will pay us for our trouble at last.”</p>

<p>It was singular that just then another fit of coughing
attacked the old lady. When it was over, she said
sharply:</p>

<p>“I’ll go to my room. I want to be composed, or I
sha’n’t sleep a wink to-night. We’ll visit to-morrow,
but I am tired after my journey. I should like some<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
one to play a little music for me in my room, but I don’t
want any sentimental songs from your girls, Laura.”</p>

<p>“The governess will sing and play for you, dear Aunt
Wroat,” said Mrs. Blight. “She has orders to obey you
during your visit, and you can command her at any or
all hours.”</p>

<p>“Then send her to me in half an hour. Charles, you
can carry me up stairs.”</p>

<p>The lawyer obeyed the intimation, carrying the old
lady up to her own room and depositing her in her armchair.
The maid was in attendance, and the lawyer and
his wife bade their guest an affecting good-night, and
retreated to the drawing-room to speculate upon their
prospects and the state of Mrs. Wroat’s health.</p>

<p>“Shut the door, Peters,” said the old lady. “And
you might open the windows and air the room after
those people’s presence.”</p>

<p>Peters obeyed. She was wont to humor all the whims
of her mistress.</p>

<p>“Did you find them the same as usual, ma’am?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Just the same, Peters,” and the old lady sighed.
“They call me ‘an old cat’ and ‘a nuisance’ in whispers,
and ‘dear Aunt Wroat’ out aloud. Miserable hypocrites!
I wanted to give them a last chance, but they
have ruined their prospects with me. Bah! A pair of
fawning, treacherous cats! They will never get a penny
of my money beyond a guinea to buy a mourning ring.”</p>

<p>“What shall you do, ma’am? Leave your money to
a charity?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do that. I won’t have it scattered and
doled out in sixpennies and shillings, when the whole
sum might go to enrich some deserving person. I’ll
leave you an annuity, Peters. You’re the only true
friend I have on earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>The woman caressed the withered hand of her old
mistress with genuine affection.</p>

<p>“Have you given up all hope of finding your own relatives,
ma’am?” she asked. “You tracked your niece
until after her marriage with a corn-chandler, and have
discovered that she died, leaving one child, a daughter,
and that her husband died also. The girl may live,
ma’am. She’s the last of your blood, and surely it’s
better to give to your own kin than to undeserving connections
or to strangers.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t find the girl,” sighed the old lady. “I’d
adopt her and leave her my money, if she was deserving
of it; but I’ve set detectives to look for her, and
they have failed to discover anything except that her
moonstruck parents named her the ‘The Vailed Prophet,’
or ‘Lalla Rookh,’ or some such nonsense. They did
find out that she had been educated like a lady—her
mother was a lady—and that she had taught music, or
drawing, or something. But she may be dead by this
time.”</p>

<p>“We might advertise for her,” cried the maid all enthusiasm.
“We could say, if Miss So and So would call
at such a place, she would hear of something to her advantage.
I do wish you would leave your money to
some nice young lady, instead of these people below. I’ll
write the advertisement immediately. What is the name
of your great-niece, Mrs. Wroat?”</p>

<p>“It’s Kubla Khan, or Lalla Rookh Bird,” answered the
old lady. “There was a crack in my niece’s brain, as
was shown by her marriage with a corn-chandler, and by
the naming of her child. I wonder what kind of a bird
the corn-chandler was,” and Mrs. Wroat laughed queerly.
“He left his daughter not one penny to bless herself
with. Write the advertisement, Peters, at once. What
geese we were not to have thought of an advertisement<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
before. If I can find and cage my Bird, Peters, and it
turns out a good and worthy Bird, I’ll leave her the
whole of my fifty thousand pounds, and you shall have
an annuity, Peters, and live with her and take care of
her. She’s only a child—not over seventeen.”</p>

<p>Peters brought out her mistress’ portable writing-desk,
and sat down before it to pen the required advertisement.
Being unused to composition, she spoiled a dozen sheets
of paper before she produced the following, which she
read aloud to her mistress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If Miss Lalla Bird will apply to the undersigned she
will hear of something to her advantage. M. W., Mount
street, London, W.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That will do,” cried Mrs. Wroat delighted. “M. W.—Maria
Wroat. Very good. We’ll have it in all the
London papers. Make a dozen copies of it, and address
them to a dozen different papers. You shall get the
post-office orders to put with them in the morning.
But let us see if the advertisement wants any improving.
Read it again.”</p>

<p>The maid did so. As she concluded, and before she
could speak, the advertisement was answered, for a
low knock was heard at the door, and the young governess,
in her black dress and with her young face pitiful
in its sadness, entered the room, and said shyly and with
a low courtesy:</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am, I’m the governess, and Mrs.
Blight sent me in to play to you. My name is Miss
Bird.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LALLY AND MRS. WROAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The simple and business-like announcement of her
name by Mrs. Blight’s young governess to Mrs. Blight’s
eccentric guest, produced a sensation as startling as unexpected
to Lally. Mrs. Wroat uttered a strange exclamation,
and leaned forward on her staff, her black eyes
staring at the young girl in a piercing gaze, her hooked
nose and her chin almost meeting, and her shrivelled lips
mumbling excitedly an inaudible whisper. The old
lady’s eagerness and agitation was shared by her maid,
who stared at Lally with a wondering and incredulous
gaze.</p>

<p>“Who—who did you say you were?” demanded Mrs.
Wroat, as soon as she could speak, in cracked, hoarse
tones—“<em>Who?</em>”</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Blight’s governess, ma’am,” replied Lally
wonderingly, and concluding that Mrs. Wroat’s eccentricities
verged upon madness.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” cried the old lady impatiently,
“but who are you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, ma’am—only Lally Bird, the governess.”</p>

<p>“Ah-h!” said the old lady, in an odd, choked voice.
“Lal-Lally Bird! Lord bless my soul, Peters!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat looked at the young governess with such
a queer snap in her eyes, and such a glow on her sallow,
withered face, that Lally involuntarily retreated a step
toward the door.</p>

<p>“It’s the young lady, ma’am,” whispered Peters, full
of amazement. “Whatever does it mean? It’s like
magic or sorcery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>“It means that our advertisement is already answered,”
returned Mrs. Wroat grimly. “Saved the post-office
orders, Peters. I believe in advertising, Peters. We’ve
just seen the benefit of it.”</p>

<p>Lally retreated another step toward the door.</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am,” she said, in a little fluttering
voice, “I will come and play for you later—”</p>

<p>“No you won’t!” interrupted Mrs. Wroat. “Now
you are here, you’ll stay here till I am through with you.
Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>Lally brought to her support a pretty, girlish dignity
which sat well upon her round gipsy face.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” she answered; “you are Mrs. Wroat,
the aunt of Mr. Blight.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. I am only his uncle’s widow. Come under
the chandelier.”</p>

<p>Lally came forward hesitatingly, and stood under the
great chandelier where a dozen wax candles burned
mellowly from a forest of tall unlighted ones. The soft
glow fell upon Lally’s face and figure. She was thin,
and there was a tremulous anxiety on her features; but
in her mourning dress, with a red flush on her dark
cheeks, and a bright light in her velvety black eyes, she
was very pretty, with a dark gipsy beauty that seemed
to startle Mrs. Wroat.</p>

<p>“The very image of poor Clara,” muttered the old
lady, “and the very image of what I was at her age.
There, Peters, if you want to see how I looked in my
youth, look at that girl.”</p>

<p>However Mrs. Wroat might have looked in her far-past
youth, she looked now like a malignant old fairy
in her gown of black velvet, and with her cloak of scarlet
velvet drawn around her shoulders. Her diamonds
were not brighter than her eyes, whose keen and piercing
glances tried to read Lally’s soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“Peters,” said the old lady, abruptly, “give the girl
that copy of the advertisement.”</p>

<p>The maid silently handed the slip of paper to Lally,
who read it in deepening amazement.</p>

<p>“Is this an advertisement for me, madam?” she demanded.
“I am Lally Bird. Are—are you ‘M. W.?’”</p>

<p>“Of ‘Mount street, London?’” finished the old lady.
“Yes, I am ‘M. W.’—Maria Wroat.”</p>

<p>“And you were about to advertise for <em>me</em>, madam? I—I
don’t understand. Or, is there some other Lally
Bird?”</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” said Mrs. Wroat. “There were
never two women in this world so silly and moonstruck
as your mother—never two women who named their
girls Lalla Rookh. Pah! What a name! But for fear
your mother was not the only goose in the world who
married a Bird, just answer me a few questions. What
was your father’s name, and what was his business?”</p>

<p>“He was a corn-chandler in the city, and his name
was John Bird,” answered Lally, quite bewildered.</p>

<p>“And what was your mother’s name before her marriage?”</p>

<p>“Clara Mulford Percy—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat gave a queer little gasp, and her hands
trembled, and she looked at her faithful attendant in a
sort of triumph.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Peters?” she whispered. “Do
you hear it, I say?” Then she added aloud, “Go on,
girl. Who was your mother?”</p>

<p>“She was the daughter of a country gentleman who
owned an estate in Hampshire. There were several
children besides my mother, but they all died young and
unmarried. The estate was entailed, and went to a distant
relative. My mother married my father against the<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
wishes of her friends, and was disowned by them for her
misalliance.”</p>

<p>“And very properly too, I should say. If a girl chooses
to descend from her proper rank in society as a gentleman’s
petted daughter, and take to living in a back room
behind a corn-chandler’s shop, she can’t expect her friends
to follow her,” said Mrs. Wroat, with some energy. “And
you were her only child?”</p>

<p>“Yes madam.”</p>

<p>“Any relatives living?”</p>

<p>“No, madam. My mother died young. My father lived
to give me a good education, and then died insolvent,
leaving me dependent upon my own exertions when I
was less than sixteen years old. My father was a tradesman,
humbly born, madam, but he was a gentleman at
heart—”</p>

<p>“So poor Clara said. Humph! So you’ve no relatives
living, eh?”</p>

<p>“None whom I know, madam. The present holder of
my grandfather’s estate in Hampshire is my distant relative,
but he knows as little of me as I know of him. And—and,”
added Lally, suddenly trembling, as if a suspicion
of the truth were dawning upon her soul, “I have a great-aunt
living in London—she was my mother’s aunt—who
married a banker, and is now a widow, if she still lives.
She must be very old.”</p>

<p>“About my age!” said Mrs. Wroat, her eyes snapping.
“Just about my age. What was her name?”</p>

<p>“Her name was Maria Percy, when a girl. She was
married many years before my mother was born, and she
was my mother’s god-mother. I don’t know her married
name. If I ever heard it, I have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell it to you,” said the old lady. “Her
present name is Maria Wroat. Her home is in Mount<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
street, London. And at this moment she sits before you,
taking stock of you.”</p>

<p>Lally grew pale, and her black eyes opened to their
widest extent.</p>

<p>“You—you my aunt?” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>“So it seems, my dear. I’ve been searching for you
for some time. And so you are Clara’s child? You may
kiss me if you want to, my dear.”</p>

<p>Lally approached the old lady with some hesitation,
and bestowed a kiss upon the proffered wrinkled cheek.
Then she shrank back in a sort of affright, wondering at
her own temerity.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said the old lady kindly. “I have a few
questions to ask you, and on your answers depend more
than you know of. Peters, don’t stare the poor child out
of countenance. Girl, how old are you?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen years, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And I’m eighty—one of us at the beginning, the
other at the end of life! Heigh-ho! And so you’re
governess here?”</p>

<p>Lally replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“No wonder you look sorrowful and pale and woe-begone!”
muttered Mrs. Wroat. “To be governess of
the young Blights is a horrible martyrdom. Don’t you
think so? And isn’t it martyrdom to be under the
orders of that odious, vulgar, garrulous Mrs. Blight?
Hey?”</p>

<p>“When I came here,” said Lally agitatedly, “I had no
home on earth. I was out of money, out of clothes, and
utterly friendless. And so, madam, I am very grateful
to Mrs. Blight for shelter and a home, and I cannot consider
any service that gives me these a martyrdom.”</p>

<p>“Grateful, eh? What have you to be grateful for?”
asked the old lady cynically. “You have shelter and
food, but you earn them, I’ll be bound. You work early<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
and late for the pitiful sum of forty pounds a year.
That is what you get, is it not?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. I am young and inexperienced, and
I needed the place so much, so I get but twenty pounds
a year.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” cried the old lady. “Because you
needed the place so much, you get only half price!
That is just like Laura Blight. How came you to be so
friendless?”</p>

<p>“After my father’s death,” said Lally, “I taught
music in the school in which I had been educated. The
school broke up, the proprietors being advanced in life
and being able to retire from labor, and I was thrown
adrift. I was obliged to do anything I could get to do.
I lived for some weeks or months with an old woman
who was seamstress to a boys’ school, and when she died
I was out of work again, and came down into Kent and
worked in the hop-fields. I was so hungry—”</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Peters?” interrupted the old lady,
turning savagely upon her attendant, her bright black
eyes beaded with tears. “Do you hear it, and sit there
unmoved? She was hungry, while my servants flung
away the dainties from my table, and I grumbled because
they could not contrive newer delicacies to tempt
my appetite. Hungry? Homeless? Friendless? Heaven
be merciful to me! Hungry! Ah-h!”</p>

<p>“That is all past now, madam,” said Lally softly.</p>

<p>“To begin again when Laura Blight chooses to send
you packing! She’s full of caprices, is Laura. You’re
not sure of a place here over night, unless her interest
bids her keep you. How much money have you laid
up?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Blight advanced me five pounds, my first quarter’s
salary, and I have eighteen shillings remaining,”
answered Lally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“Humph. Eighteen shillings between you and the
union. Look me in the eye, Lally.”</p>

<p>The young girl obeyed, looking into Mrs. Wroat’s
piercing eyes with a steady, honest, unflinching gaze,
although the color fluttered in and out of her cheeks, as
a bird flutters in and out of its cage.</p>

<p>“Have you ever done anything in your life of which
you are ashamed?” asked the old lady, in a low, sternly
anxious voice.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” answered the girl truthfully, “I never
have.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of her, Peters?” demanded Mrs.
Wroat, turning to her maid and confidant.</p>

<p>The woman was crying behind her handkerchief. She
had hard features, but her heart was warm and soft.
She answered sobbingly:</p>

<p>“I think, ma’am, as you’d ought to take her and adopt
her, and make her your heiress—that’s what I think,
poor, pretty dear!”</p>

<p>“Shows your sense, Peters,” said Mrs. Wroat. “You’re
a woman of a thousand, Peters, and I’ll double the annuity
I’m going to give you. Girl, come and sit here on
the stool at my feet.”</p>

<p>Lally came forward and sat down as directed.</p>

<p>“I am alone in the world, except for my good old
Peters,” said Mrs. Wroat, with a quiver of her pointed,
up-turned chin. “These people here think only of what
they can make out of me—of the fortune they hope to inherit
at my death. I am old, and very near my end. I
should like to leave my money to one of my own kindred,
and to one who would really mourn a little for me when I
am gone. I’m a queer old woman, Lally, full of notions,
and so cross that any one but Peters would have given
me up long ago; but, strange as it may seem, the good
soul actually loves me. She’s been in my service five<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
and thirty years, and she’s more a friend to me than a
servant. Now, Lally, do you think you could ever love
me? It’s odd, I own, but even a dried-up old woman
like me sometimes yearns to be loved.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and tears brimmed over the bright
black eyes, and her sharp features were convulsed in
sudden emotion. She looked at Lally with a strange
wistfulness and yearning, and Lally’s desolate, frozen
soul thawed within her, and with a great sob she sprang
up and threw her arms around her aged kinswoman, and
kissed her fervently and tenderly.</p>

<p>“I have no one to love,” whispered the girl, sobbing.
“I would love you if you would let me.”</p>

<p>A paroxysm of coughing seized upon the old lady, and
Lally shrank back affrighted into her seat. Peters patted
her mistress gently on her back and gave her water to
drink, and she soon recovered, sinking back upon her
cushions, tired and panting.</p>

<p>“I am near the end, my dear,” she said, when she
could command her voice. “I may live weeks, or it
may be months; but the time is short. I like you, Lally,
and I am going to adopt you and make you my heiress.
You shall change your name to mine, and be known as
Lally Wroat, and at my death you shall inherit my fifty
thousand pounds. And all I ask of you, Lally, is to
love me a little, and try to be a daughter to me. I never
had a daughter of my own.”</p>

<p>Lally raised the old lady’s hand reverently to her lips.</p>

<p>“I am afraid all this happiness is not for me, madam,”
she said bravely. “I am not what you think me, and
you may not deem me fit to inherit your wealth. I—I
have been married!”</p>

<p>“Peters, the girl’s head is turned.”</p>

<p>“No, madam, I speak the truth. I am pure in the
sight of God, but I am a disowned wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“A wife—at seventeen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam. After I lost my situation as music
teacher I was married to a young gentleman, just from
Oxford, where he had been educated. He was only
twenty years old, and we were married by license. He
worked to support us, having talent as an artist, and we
struggled along together until his father discovered our
marriage and separated us, declaring the marriage null
and void, his son being under twenty-one years of age.
We were married in good faith; we loved each other;
and Rufus was good, although he made oath that he was
of age in order to secure the marriage license. His father
threatened to prosecute him for perjury if he did not
give me up; and he gave me up.”</p>

<p>“And who is this precious youth?” asked Mrs. Wroat.</p>

<p>Lally replied by telling her story precisely as it had
occurred, excusing the conduct of her young husband as
well as she could, and displaying in every look and word
how passionately she still loved him.</p>

<p>“So the young man is poor, but of good birth and
connections, and university bred?” commented Mrs.
Wroat. “Well, Lally, my opinion is that your husband
is not free from you, but that he will have to have recourse
to law to secure his freedom. We’ll consult my
London lawyer when we get up to town, and we’ll see
about the young man. I’m afraid he’s a poor stick; but
we’ll see—we’ll see. I haven’t changed my mind about
adopting you, and I shall immediately assume a guardianship
over you. You will quit Mrs. Blight’s service
to-morrow. Peters, how soon can we go back to town?”</p>

<p>“At the end of the week, ma’am, if you like,” responded
Peters, brightening.</p>

<p>“So be it then. Pack your trunk, Lally. You will
finish your stay in this house as my adopted daughter<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
and future heiress, and to-morrow you and Peters shall
go out shopping—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat paused, as a knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>“Open the door, Peters,” commanded the old lady.
“It’s Laura Blight.”</p>

<p>Before Peters could obey, the door opened from without,
and Mrs. Blight, her chains tinkling and her red
silk gown rustling, came into the room as airily as the
rotund proportions of her figure would permit.</p>

<p>Her glances fell upon Lally, who was still sitting at
the feet of her great-aunt, and Mrs. Blight’s face showed
her surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear the piano, dear Aunt Wroat,” she exclaimed,
“and I feared my governess might not have
obeyed my order and come in to you. Miss Bird, I fear
you forget your place. You are not a guest in this
house—you are merely a hired servant. If you try, like
a treacherous viper, to creep into the good graces of my
poor unsuspecting relative, I shall dismiss you in the
morning. You are to play upon the piano, and then go
to your room.”</p>

<p>The old lady’s yellow and bony hand was stretched
out and laid caressingly on Lally’s black hair.</p>

<p>“I was talking to the child, Laura,” she said. “I
have been hearing her history. Don’t you remember
that I’ve been trying for years to find my niece, Clara
Bird, or her children? Well, this girl is Clara’s child—”</p>

<p>A look of fear and anger disfigured Mrs. Blight’s face.
The girl became, upon the instant, a terror to her.</p>

<p>“Aunt Wroat,” said the lawyer’s wife hastily, “this
girl is a mere imposter that I took in out of charity.
She has deceived you. Miss Bird, go to your room at
once. To-morrow morning you leave my house.”</p>

<p>“Peters,” said Mrs. Wroat quietly, “give me my
purse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>Peters brought a plethoric pocket-book from her mistress’
traveling-bag, and the old lady took out a five-pound
Bank of England note.</p>

<p>“Give that to Mrs. Blight, Peters,” continued the old
lady calmly. “Mrs. Blight, that is the amount you advanced
to my great-niece when she entered your service.
I do not wish her to be indebted to you. And here are
twenty pounds to reimburse you for any expense I may
have put you to. I am sorry, Laura, to disappoint you,”
added Mrs. Wroat, putting her wallet in her pocket,
“but you and your husband need the lesson. I am not
so deaf but that I heard every whisper you and your
husband exchanged in the drawing-room to-night. I
am aware that you consider me ‘an old cat,’ and ‘an
old nuisance,’ and that you ‘would send me to an alms-house,
if it were not for my money.’ I have now only to
say to you that your heartlessness has met with its appropriate
reward. This young lady is my adopted daughter
and future heiress, and when you order a cab for
her in the morning, you may let the boy come up for
my luggage also. I shall go with my adopted daughter.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA AND HER ENEMIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neva Wynde had arrived in London, by the morning
express train from Canterbury, in the care of Mr. and
Mrs. Craven Black, and from the moment in which she
had emerged with them from the railway station, all
clue to her movements was suddenly and mysteriously
lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>What had become of her? How had she so singularly
disappeared?</p>

<p>These questions, which filled the souls of Neva’s lover
and guardians with such unspeakable terror and anxiety
and which they so signally failed in their efforts to
solve, we now purpose answering for the benefit of the
reader.</p>

<p>On alighting from the crowded morning train, Craven
Black hurried his bride, her maid and Neva into a waiting
cab, superintended the mounting of the luggage to
the stout cab roof, and gave the order to be driven to
Gravesend, adding more explicit directions in an undertone.
He then entered the vehicle, and the vehicle
rolled from the station.</p>

<p>“Where are we going, Mrs. Black?” asked Neva, looking
from the cab windows. “I fancied Mr. Black said
Gravesend.”</p>

<p>“So he did, my dear,” said Mrs. Craven Black placidly.
“Didn’t I tell you that we are going to Yorkshire
by water? September is such a lovely month, and this is
such lovely weather, and it’s quite the thing to take a
sea trip for a bridal tour, and I prevailed upon Craven
to charter—is not that the word—a beautiful little
yacht, which we are to have three months if we want it.
We shall have a glorious voyage down the Thames and
up the Channel, and through the great German ocean.
The very idea stirs all my love of romance. Doesn’t it
affect you in the same manner!”</p>

<p>“But Wynde Heights is not near the sea,” objected
Neva, in surprise.</p>

<p>“It’s not two hours distant by rail, and it will be delightful
to get up yachting parties by ourselves, and go
off for a two-days’ excursion; don’t you think so? Don’t
throw cold water upon my little plans for happiness, I
beg of you, my dear Neva,” cried Mrs. Craven Black imploringly.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
“There is no reason why we shouldn’t be
perfectly happy, if you won’t interpose objections,
Neva.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Neva took care to “interpose” no more
objections. She had no liking for nor trust in Craven
Black, but Mrs. Craven Black had been her father’s beloved
and honored wife, and Neva still believed in her.
That the pair could mean her harm never once occurred
to her. Neither did she realize how completely she was
in their power. She had left her maid at home, at Mrs.
Black’s solicitation, the latter declaring that one maid
would suffice for both, and that she especially disliked
Meggy West, the girl who attended upon Neva. Thus
the young heiress of Hawkhurst was absolutely friendless
and helpless, in the hands of her enemies.</p>

<p>They had a long drive to Gravesend. On arriving at
their destination, they alighted at a pier at which a small
boat with two oarsmen was lying. These men were
dressed in blue sailor custom, each having an arrow
embroidered on the breast of his jacket. Mr. Black
went up to them, accosting them familiarly.</p>

<p>“What boat do you belong to?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“To the <em>Arrow</em>, sir, lying out yonder,” said one of the
men, pointing to a graceful yacht lying in the stream,
her sails unfurled, and looking ready for flight. “We
are waiting for Mr. Craven Black.”</p>

<p>“I am he. It’s all right, my men. Octavia, my love,
let me assist you into the boat. Miss Wynde, this way.”</p>

<p>The maid was left to scramble in by herself. The
luggage was deposited in the boat; Mr. Black took his
seat, and the rowers pulled off for the yacht.</p>

<p>The process of transferring passengers and luggage to
the deck of the <em>Arrow</em> was speedily and safely accomplished.
Mrs. Black was ecstatic in her commendations
of the arrangements of the little vessel, and occupied the<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
attention of Neva while Mr. Black conversed with the
sailors and their captain, and the vessel was gotten
under way.</p>

<p>The <em>Arrow</em> was no means a new vessel but she had
been recently painted and fitted with new sails, and presented
a very trim appearance. She was of about twenty
tons burden. She had belonged to a member of the
Royal Yacht Club, but had been advertised to be sold
for a comparatively small sum, her owner having had
built for him a vessel of greater size and speed. Craven
Black had seen, a week before, the advertisment offering
the <em>Arrow</em> for sale, and warranting her ready to put to
sea at an hour’s notice; and a part of the business of
Mrs. Artress in town had been to purchase the vessel.</p>

<p>Among his friends of high and low degree, Craven
Black possessed one who was thoroughly disreputable,
but who had proved useful to him at too many periods
of his life to be thrown aside. This person had formerly
been a lawyer, but had been stricken from the rolls for
illegal or dishonorable practice, and was a needy hanger-on
and parasite of Craven Black. This person had been
called upon to assist Mrs. Artress in the examination of
the yacht, and had purchased the boat in his own name,
paying therefor a sum of money provided by Mrs. Craven
Black out of the jointure acquired by her marriage with
Sir Harold Wynde. This ex-lawyer had also engaged
three experienced sailors, one of whom had been a mate
on an India vessel, and whom he hired as captain of the
<em>Arrow</em>, and these three men were now in charge of the
little yacht.</p>

<p>These sailors, we may as well mention here, had been
chosen for other qualifications than good seamanship.
The ex-lawyer, in the days when he had been qualified to
practice his profession, had been called upon to defend
the three against a charge of mutiny, preferred against<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
them by their captain. The charge had been proved,
they had been convicted, and were now fresh from two
years’ imprisonment. The ex-lawyer had come upon
them at a drinking shop, after their release, and only a
few days before, and knowing their reckless character,
had engaged them for a cruise of the <em>Arrow</em>.</p>

<p>Such was the character of the seamen in charge of the
yacht; and in such manner had the yacht itself been
acquired by Craven Black.</p>

<p>As the vessel moved forward down the stream, the
sails filling, Mrs. Black said to her young charge:</p>

<p>“Let us go below, Neva, and take a look at our quarters.
The luggage and my maid have gone down.”</p>

<p>Neva assented, and the two went into the cabin,
which was found to be newly fitted up, and smelling unpleasantly
of fresh paint. The cabin was small, affording
room only for the table and divans around it, but
there were three neat little state-rooms, newly carpeted
and newly furnished with mattresses, blankets, bed-linen,
towels, camp chairs, and all toilet appurtenances. One
of these state-rooms was appropriated by Mr. and Mrs.
Black, the second by Neva, and the third was assigned
to the maid, a French woman completely won to the
interests of her mistress.</p>

<p>“We shall be very comfortable here, Neva,” said Mrs.
Black, with gayety. “The sea air will bring the roses to
your cheeks. I think you’ve not been looking well lately.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had told me that we were to go to Yorkshire
by sea,” said Neva gravely.</p>

<p>“How could I suppose, my dear child, that you cared
whether you went by train or by boat?” demanded Mrs.
Black, in seeming surprise. “Your dear papa told me
once that you were a fine sailor, and I planned this voyage
as a little surprise to you—that’s the truth, Neva.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said the young girl, “but I<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
would have preferred to know it beforehand. My friends
will be anxious about me if I do not write as soon as I
promised.”</p>

<p>“Your friends?” and Mrs. Black arched her brows.
“Are we not your friends?”</p>

<p>“You are, madam, I trust, but you are not my only
friend. I leave those behind me who are dear to me,
and who have a right to know my movements.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black looked significantly down upon the great
diamond that sparkled in limpid splendor upon Neva’s
finger. She had noticed the jewel before, but had refrained
from alluding to it.</p>

<p>“Is that ring the gift of one who has a right to know
your movements?” she asked, smiling.</p>

<p>Neva blushed, but gravely assented.</p>

<p>“It is from Rufus Black?” asked the elder lady, well
knowing to the contrary.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” said Neva bravely, “it is the gift of
Lord Towyn, and is the emblem of our betrothal.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black bit her lips fiercely, but made no response.
There was a hardness in her glittering eyes, and a cruel
compression of her lips, that boded ill for the engagement
thus proclaimed to her.</p>

<p>One of the seamen was an excellent cook and steward,
and presently a luncheon was spread in the cabin which
proved very tempting to appetites sharpened by sea air.
Mrs. Artress had provided such an abundance of delicate
stores that a cook was scarcely required. There
were tin boxes of assorted biscuits, jars of pickles, boxes
of fruits of every kind attainable in Covent Garden
market, dried and crystalized fruits, smoked salmon,
jerked beef and venison, pickled reindeers’ tongues, and
cheeses, cakes and fancy breads in every variety.</p>

<p>After the luncheon, the ladies went on deck, Mr. and
Mrs. Craven Black paced to and fro, arm in arm, and<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
Neva leaned idly upon the rail, watching the fleeting
shores and the frequent sails and steamers, and tried to
shake off the shadow of distrust and gloom that would
creep over her soul.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, dinner was served in the cabin. This
second meal resembled the one that had preceded, but
there were also roast beef, roast fowls, and vegetables,
and wines. The swinging lamp was lighted in the cabin,
which looked as comfortable as a yacht cabin can be
made to look. There is, at best, a dreariness about a
ship’s cabin or state-room which no art can conquer.
And this cabin was no exception to the rule. Neva was
glad to throw a shawl around her and go out again upon
the deck.</p>

<p>The moon was shining when she sat down at one side
of the boat in her folding deck chair, and the pale flood
of silvery light illumined the white-capped waves, and
the dark abysses of the waters, the sails of vessels
making into port, and the dusky little steamers, making
the whole scene a picture full of glorious lights and
shadows, but a scene that seemed a picture rather than
a reality.</p>

<p>The yacht was out in the North Sea now, battling
with the short, chopping waves, but impelled onward
by a fine breeze. She was well ballasted, seaworthy,
and a swift sailer. What more could be desired by the
guilty pair whose hearts beat exultantly at their evil
success, as they regarded the unconscious victim of their
machinations.</p>

<p>“She has no suspicion,” murmured Craven Black, as
he promenaded the deck, his wife leaning on his arm.</p>

<p>“None whatever. She is too guileless herself to suspect
guile in others. And she trusts me implicitly,”
laughed Octavia Black softly.</p>

<p>“That old dotard, her father, did you and me a good<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
turn when he so frequently urged his daughter to obey
me and love me, and try to win my love. I declare,
Craven, it’s enough to make the old fellow come out of
his grave, to confront us; isn’t it now?”</p>

<p>“If I were superstitions, I might think so,” said
Black.</p>

<p>“If he did come out of his grave, he’d be slightly
astonished at finding how I had cajoled and hoodwinked
him, eh, Craven?” said the woman mockingly. “I’d like
him to find out the truth where he is; I would, indeed.
I hated the man; and to think you were jealous of him
even when you urged me to marry him! Oh, Craven?
Do you know, dear, speaking of jealousy, I was once
jealous of Neva Wynde?”</p>

<p>“I did not know it.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, I was. It was absurd, of course. I fancied
you fell in love with her the first time you saw her.”</p>

<p>Craven Black’s heart stirred guiltily, and his fair cheek
flushed. His love for Neva Wynde was not altogether
dead yet. It smouldered in his breast, and although at
times he believed that he felt an absolute hatred for her,
yet all the while a spark of the old passion remained
that circumstances might again fan into a flame.</p>

<p>“We’re likely to have more trouble than we looked
for,” said Mrs. Black, changing the subject, without
awaiting a reply to her previous remark. “Neva owned
to me since we came on board that she is engaged to
Lord Towyn.”</p>

<p>“I suspected it when I saw that new ring she wears.
But go to her now, Octavia. She will suspect us of
plotting against her if we whisper together longer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black relinquished her husband’s arm, and went
to Neva’s side, drawing a deck chair beside her.</p>

<p>“Enjoying the moonlight, Neva?” she asked. “And
thinking of the earl, of course? I have not yet wished<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
you joy of your future husband, and I suppose I ought
to do so now. But first I would like to ask you if you
have irrevocably chosen to obey your own wishes in
regard to your marriage, rather than to regard the last
wishes of your father?”</p>

<p>“I am not certain what were my father’s wishes,” said
Neva, with a strange gravity, looking afar over the
waters with her eyes of red gloom.</p>

<p>“Not certain? My dear child, you puzzle me. Did I
not give into your own hands your father’s last letter to
you, received by me from India in the same mail that
brought me the awful news of his death?”</p>

<p>“You gave me a letter purporting to be from my
father, Mrs. Black,” said the young girl, looking now at
her companion, “but are you sure that it was not
changed by any one while in your possession? Do not
think I would hint one word against your watchful care
of it, or—or—your good faith with me; but I am not
altogether convinced that papa wrote that letter. Lord
Towyn, on reading it, immediately declared it a forgery.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black started.</p>

<p>“Did you show it to Lord Towyn?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he has it now in his possession, and will
submit it to Sir John Freise and Mr. Atkins for their
inspection and opinion,” answered Neva.</p>

<p>Octavia Black’s dark cheeks paled in the moonlight,
and a sudden terror gathered in her hard black eyes.</p>

<p>“Neva,” she exclaimed harshly, “I am astonished at
the singular want of delicacy that prompted your display
of your father’s last letter to Lord Towyn. Of
course the earl believes the letter a forgery, since he
purposes marrying you himself. He believes whatever it
is to his interest to believe.”</p>

<p>“Lord Towyn is the soul of honor,” asserted Neva, her<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
cheeks flushing hotly. “He would tell the truth, whether
it might be for or against his interests.”</p>

<p>“What simple, childlike faith!” murmured Octavia
Black, in affected admiration. “But, my dear child,
Lord Towyn is no better than other men. Did—did he
think that <em>I</em> forged Sir Harold’s letter?”</p>

<p>“No, he has too high an opinion of the lady who has
been my father’s wife,” returned Neva proudly, “to think
such evil of her. But he fancied the true letter might
have been replaced with a forged one. Mrs. Artress—Mr.
Black—”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, having been urged into saying
more than she had intended.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lord Towyn thinks them capable of the forgery.
Let me tell you, Neva Wynde, that your father told me
with his own lips that he had once hoped for your marriage
with Lord Towyn, but that he desired in his later
days with all his mind and heart that you should marry
Rufus Black.”</p>

<p>“Papa said that—to you?”</p>

<p>“He did. I swear it,” cried the woman, perjuring herself,
in her eagerness to produce the desired impression
upon Neva’s mind.</p>

<p>“But Rufus said he did not know papa?”</p>

<p>“That does not affect the fact that Sir Harold knew
him,” said Octavia Black firmly. “Rufus did some
brave deed at Oxford—saved a comrade’s life, or some
such thing—and that first fixed Sir Harold’s eyes upon
him. From that moment Sir Harold watched the young
fellow’s progress. He saw him frequently, himself unseen.
He studied his character, and he became resolved upon
your marriage to Rufus.”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Black, this is incredible!” exclaimed Neva,
utterly refusing to believe the preposterous story, although
until this moment her faith in her companion had<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
remained unshaken. “Papa could not have wished me
to marry a man he did not know personally. He would
not have laid upon me the burden of a command—for that
solemnly expressed desire was little less than a command—to
marry a man whom he admired for a single act of
personal courage, but of whose character he was ignorant.
I know papa too well to believe anything like this, Mrs.
Black.”</p>

<p>“You accuse me of falsehood then. I say such was his
wish!” declared Octavia, doggedly and sullenly.</p>

<p>Neva looked pained, perplexed, and deeply troubled.</p>

<p>“If this indeed be so,” she murmured, “then he could
not have been in his right mind, terrible as it seems to
utter the words. For there never was a truer, kinder
father, or a more noble man, than papa. He thought my
happiness of so much moment that he never would have
dictated my course in such a vital matter as the acceptance
or rejection of a lover, so long as the lover was
worthy. I am sorry you have told me this, Mrs. Black.
I am compelled to doubt papa’s complete sanity, or—or—”</p>

<p>“Or me?” said the handsome Octavia, with an ugly
frown. “You ought to know me too well by this time to
doubt me. Old gentlemen frequently get odd ideas,
which seem at variance with their usual character, but
the having them does not prove them insane, only
crotchety. As for me, knowing Sir Harold’s wishes, I
did not doubt that you would act upon them as upon his
actual command. Your father told you to obey me
in all things. Is that command to be as lightly set
aside?”</p>

<p>“Have I failed to consider your wishes, madam?” asked
Neva sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Not until now. But it is my wish that you should
marry Rufus Black. Nay it is my command.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>Neva’s pure proud face looked very white in the
moonlight, as she answered:</p>

<p>“Then I must fail in my obedience to you now, Mrs.
Black. Papa did not desire me to obey unreasonable
commands, to the destruction of my own happiness.
He would consider you unfaithful to the charge he gave
you, could he know that you are urging me to marry
Rufus Black. My rejection of Rufus was final.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” said Mrs. Black, compressing her lips.</p>

<p>In an angry mood, Octavia walked away, joining her
husband on the opposite side of the deck. Neva leaned
over the low railing, her face upturned to the stars, and
murmured:</p>

<p>“Perhaps—perhaps, after all, <em>she</em> forged the letter.
How strange she seems to-night. I fear her. I wish I
had not come with her. A terrible gloom is on my soul
to-night!”</p>

<p>That gloom grew heavier and darker, and the pure
face grew whiter and more sorrowful as the time went
on, and the yacht bowled on toward the northward,
bound—ah whither?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WHERE NEVA’S TRAVELS ENDED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neva Wynde sat until a late hour upon the deck,
watching the play of the moonlight on the waters, the
leaping white crests of the waves, and the white furrow
plowed by the <em>Arrow</em> as she sped onward over the
waters on her way to the northward.</p>

<p>The prophetic gloom settled down yet more darkly
upon the young girl’s soul. A bitter, homesick yearning<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
filled her heart—a yearning for her father’s love to
shield her, her father’s arm to lean upon, and her father’s
wisdom to counsel her.</p>

<p>Ah, could she but have known that far away upon
other seas, but under starlit skies, and speeding as fast
as steam and wind could bear him, her father whom she
so mourned as dead—her father was hurrying toward
his home, with the same homesick longing in his breast,
the same yearning, to clasp her in his arms, together
with the false wife he so idolized!</p>

<p>And could that false wife have but guessed the truth,
as she paced the yacht’s deck arm in arm with her husband,
conspiring against the peace and happiness of
Neva, much of grief and terror that was lying in wait
for the baronet’s daughter, and much of guilt and
wickedness that the two conspirators were planning,
might have been avoided. But neither knew nor
guessed the truth, and long before Sir Harold could
arrive in England, Neva’s fate was likely to be decided
by herself or her enemies.</p>

<p>At a late hour the young heiress went to her state-room,
Mrs. Craven Black bidding her a careless good-night
as she passed. Mrs. Black’s French maid Celeste
was in the cabin, yawning and out of temper, and she
accompanied Neva to her room and assisted her to disrobe.
Neva soon dismissed her, finished her night toilet,
and knelt to pray by her small port window, through
which she could see the dusky azure sky gemmed with
stars, and the white waves glorified by the shimmering
pale moonlight.</p>

<p>Neva crept into her narrow berth, leaving her lantern
on the wall burning. She could not sleep. A feverish
unrest was upon her. The first shadow of distrust of
Octavia Black had flung its gloom across her pathway.
Until this night she had been full of innocent child-like<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
faith in the woman her father had deemed as pure as an
angel. Sir Harold’s praises of his second wife had been
received by Neva without allowance, and without suspicion
that he might be deceived. She had an implicit
reliance upon his judgment, but now she questioned,
with a terrible pang, if he had not been deceived.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe Mrs. Black when she says that papa
was determined to marry me to a man of whom my
father knew nothing, save that he had committed a noble
deed upon impulse. And when I refused to believe the
story, there was a look on Mrs. Black’s face I have never
before seen there, a look as of convicted treachery and
falsehood. I distrust her—I almost fear her! I am
sorry I came with her. And if it be true that she is
false and treacherous, I am reconciled at last to papa’s
horrible death. He could never have borne the knowledge
of her real character!”</p>

<p>She sighed, and turned restlessly on her pillow.</p>

<p>“I believe Craven Black to be a villain,” her thoughts
ran presently. “He made love to me when he was already
engaged to marry my father’s widow. I am sure he hates
me now. Perhaps he has perverted her mind against me?
Perhaps she never liked me? I was never allowed to
come back to my own home after she entered it, not
even when dear papa died, and my heart seemed breaking,
until Madame Dalant wrote that my school-days
should terminate, and that I ought to be allowed to
enter society. Mrs. Black has a caressing manner
toward me, and flatters me, but I am sure she does not
love me. Perhaps the two are my enemies? If so, how
completely I am in their power, having even left my faithful
maid behind me, at Mrs. Black’s request. I fear I
have been blind—blind!”</p>

<p>Poor Neva was now thoroughly alarmed. She remembered
a score of incidents, scarcely noticed at the time<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
that went far to confirm the truth of her sudden suspicion
that Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black were her enemies
and that they were conspiring against her. She struggled
with her conviction, calling herself foolish, romantic
and ungrateful, but the conviction remained.</p>

<p>The fact that the yacht had been engaged for the voyage
to Yorkshire, when she expected to go by train, and
that she had not been told of the proposed route until
her arrival in London, recurred to her unpleasantly, and
as something of sinister moment.</p>

<p>The fact also, that Mrs. Craven Black had a keen
personal interest in Neva’s marriage to Rufus Black,
now for the first time obtruded itself upon the young
girl.</p>

<p>“Rufus is Craven Black’s son,” she said to herself,
“and if I were married to Rufus, Craven Black would
probably assume control of all my property! I acquit
Rufus of any share in the conspiracy, but he is so weak
of will that he would not dare to resist his father, who
could appropriate half my income to his own use. Can
this be Craven Black’s design? Can Craven Black have
forged that last letter purporting to come from papa?
And does Octavia know his designs, and willingly aid
him to carry them out? I must study them closely,
without seeming to do so. I must be on my guard.”</p>

<p>With thoughts like these, Neva tossed upon her pillow
for hours, until long after Craven Black and his bride
had retired to their state-room, and silence had fallen
upon the cabin, and the creaking of a block, or the rattling
of cordage, or a voice or footstep on the little
deck, sounded through the night with startling loudness,
and as something new and strange.</p>

<p>At last she fell asleep, but her slumber was not refreshing,
and she was looking very pale and worn when,<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
after a careful toilet in the morning, she came out into
the cabin.</p>

<p>The breakfast was spread upon the table and Mr. and
Mrs. Craven Black were seated upon a divan, conversing
in whispers. They started guiltily at Neva’s appearance,
and Mrs. Black cried out gayly:</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear. You are a laggard this
morning. It is ten o’clock, and I have already taken a
constitutional on deck. It’s a fine, bracing air.”</p>

<p>“I hope I have not kept you waiting,” said Neva
courteously.</p>

<p>“Did you think us barbarous enough to eat our breakfast
before your coming?” cried Craven Black, with exaggerated
courtesy. “Sorry not to see you looking better.
Did you pass a pleasant night?”</p>

<p>“I did not sleep very well,” answered Neva quietly.</p>

<p>She took her place at the table, and Craven Black
waited upon her and his wife with careful attention.
The breakfast consisted of stewed chicken, coffee, bread,
fancy biscuits, and delicate fruits, including oranges,
grapes, and peaches, and Neva brought to the meal an
appetite sharpened by the sea air.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall sleep at Wynde Heights to-night?”
said Neva, forcing a cheerfulness she did not feel. “We
must reach Yorkshire at our present rate of sailing long
before evening. Do you purpose landing at Scarborough,
or Whitby, or Stockton, Mr. Black?” she asked. “All
three are railway stations, and we can go on to the
Heights without delay.”</p>

<p>The husband and wife exchanged significant glances.</p>

<p>“Neva, dear,” said Mrs. Black caressingly, “would
you care if we do not go to Wynde Heights? You
know the place so little, and have no acquaintances in
the neighborhood; and I have none, and I dread a visit<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
to the Yorkshire dower house as something dull and
stupid beyond comparison.”</p>

<p>Neva looked at the speaker with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“Are we not on our way to Wynde Heights, Mrs.
Black?” she demanded, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, if you insist upon adhering to the strict
letter of our original plan,” answered Mrs. Black. “But
I am sure you will not be so hard-hearted and cruel. I
no longer want to go to Wynde Heights, and Craven
thinks a stay there would be a bore; but of course, if
you insist upon it, we will sacrifice our own pleasure to
yours.”</p>

<p>Neva struggled with her bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I supposed we were on our way to Wynde Heights,”
she said, “but do not suppose I desire to go there, if
you prefer to go elsewhere. It is your wish and pleasure,
Mrs. Black, that must be consulted. Would you
prefer a watering place, or a visit to the German coast?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” said Mrs. Black. “I am <em>so</em> relieved, dear
Neva, for I feared you would oppose my wishes, and I
think if a woman ought ever to have her own way, it
should be on her bridal tour. Craven has been telling
me of the only piece of property he owns in the world, a
worthless old Highland estate, valueless except for the
shooting, with a dear old tumble-down house which no
one will rent, and I fairly long to see it. It’s quite natural,
I think, for a bride to desire to visit her husband’s
property, and this came to Craven through his Scottish
ancestors, the Macdonalds, and it has a host of curious
legends and ghost stories, and such a charming, romantic
name—Wilderness—that I am impatient to go there; and
Craven says, if you do not object we will go on to Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Where is this place?” asked Neva.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>“In Rosshire. There are post-offices convenient, so
that you can write back daily, if you like.”</p>

<p>“But our coming will be unexpected,” objected Neva.
“The servants at Wynde Heights are prepared for our
coming, but no one will look for us at Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“There is an old couple residing there,” said Craven
Black, “and everything will be done to make our stay
pleasant at my old ‘Castle Rackrent.’ I confess I should
like to take my bride to the old place—it is years since I
was there—and a week could be very pleasantly passed
in mountain excursions, rows on the loch, and rides to
the village. Can I say nothing to melt the stern resolution
I see expressed in your face, Miss Neva?”</p>

<p>“September seems late for the Highlands,” said Neva.</p>

<p>“But this is exceptionally lovely weather,” urged Mrs.
Black. “And we only want to stay there a week. I see
you mean to destroy all our pleasure, Neva, and condemn
us to follow your lead.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said Neva gravely. “I have no
desire to urge my own wishes in the matter. This project
of visiting the Highlands takes me by surprise, but
I have nothing to urge against it. I wish, however,” she
added coloring, “that you would land me at some convenient
point on the coast, and permit me to return to
Hawkhurst—”</p>

<p>“What! Alone and unattended?” cried Mrs. Black.
“You wish to desert us, when I count upon your companionship
and society? If you insist upon returning
to Hawkhurst, Neva, of course you can go, and we will
go with you. But this selfish tyranny—forgive me—is
not like your generous self. I would not have believed
you so ungracious. My pleasure is quite spoiled.
Craven, dear, let us turn back to London.”</p>

<p>Mr. Black arose to go on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>Neva detained him by a gesture, her proud face flushing.</p>

<p>“You need not turn back upon my account,” she said
half haughtily. “I will accompany Mrs. Black to the
Wilderness. I have no wish to appear ungracious, but
you will remember that my friends do not know where
I am, and may be anxious about me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Neva!” cried Mrs. Black reproachfully. “Are
we not your best friends? But I am too happy in your
concession to find fault with your phraseology. Craven,
we will go to your dear old Wilderness, and if I like it,
I’ll fit it up for a shooting-box, and next year we will
come up here the gayest party that ever visited the ‘land
o’ cakes.’”</p>

<p>Neva did not linger in the cabin, but went out on deck,
and walked to and fro for exercise, while her eyes scanned
the waters and the horizon.</p>

<p>The yacht was far out upon the wide North Sea, or
German Ocean, a mere speck in the wild waste of waters.
There were sails gleaming in the distance in the clear
September sunshine, but no shores were visible. The
wind was blowing fair and free, the sky was clear, the
air crisp and chilly, but nevertheless agreeable.</p>

<p>Neva walked alone until she grew tired, and then sat
down in her folding deck chair and thought until her
brain was wearied. Mr. and Mrs. Black joined her, and
talked and chatted for some hours. Luncheon was
served on the deck, and the afternoon wore on as the
morning had done.</p>

<p>Night again settled down upon the sea, so bright with
moonlight and starlight that it was not less lovely than
the day had been. Neva went to bed early, and slept
profoundly, not being even visited by dreams.</p>

<p>The next day passed as the other had done, but the
coast was not yet seen. The wind proved variable upon<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
this day, but Craven Black consulted his charts frequently,
and talked with the sailors, and Mrs. Black
yawned, and declared that a sea voyage was charming,
but intolerably dull.</p>

<p>A third night dragged by, and Neva began to be anxious
to get into port. She knew that Lord Towyn must
be looking for a letter from her, and she desired to inform
him of Mrs. Black’s change of plan of travel, and of
her own whereabouts.</p>

<p>Upon the fourth day after leaving London, the graceful
little yacht stood in for the land. Mrs. Black and
Neva, as usual, spent the day on deck. About noon the
<em>Arrow</em> sped into Moray Frith, in the wake of a steamer
bound for Inverness and the Caledonian canal, and followed
by one or two sailing vessels which were allowed
to pass the swifter yacht.</p>

<p>“Do we go into Inverness?” asked Neva, as she
looked at the chart which Craven Black was exhibiting
to her and his wife.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Black. “Look at the chart, Miss
Wynde. Do you see those narrow straits that connect
Moray Frith with Cromarty Frith? We thread those
straits, and a not very pleasant excursion it is either.
Once safe in Cromarty Frith, we have plain sailing. I
expect to sleep at Wilderness to-night.”</p>

<p>The yacht in good time threaded the straits, and came
out into the calmer waters of the loch-like Cromarty
Frith, sailing up a portion of its distance, and then
obeying the skillful hand at the helm, it shot into a deep
stream or river, and went on into the very shadow and
heart of the wild mountain region.</p>

<p>It seemed to Neva, as she looked around her in wonder,
awe and delight, that the chaos of the primeval
creation yet reigned here. She saw no villages, no hamlets,
no houses, no signs of habitation—nothing but<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
grim mountain peaks and ranges, frowning cliffs, and
inaccessible rocks. The very vegetation was sparse and
stunted, the few trees wildly clinging to niches in the
bare rocks, being dwarfed and sickly. Upon higher
peaks in the distance, Neva saw glittering crowns of
snow, but nearer all was deadness, desolation, chaos.</p>

<p>“It looks as if this part of the earth had been abandoned
by God and shunned by man,” she thought.
“The utter dreariness is oppressive and terrible.”</p>

<p>The <em>Arrow</em> felt her way on up the river, the banks
growing steeper and narrower, the rocks and cliffs more
frowning, and the waters blacker. Mrs. Black began to
look nervous, and to express a fear that the vessel would
presently be caught in the narrowing throat of rocks,
but her husband smiled reassuringly, and a little later
the yacht shot into a little placid mountain loch, shut in
by towering mountains, the waters looking black with
the everlasting shadows of the hills bending above
them.</p>

<p>Both the ladies breathed freer at this unlooked for
termination to their voyage. Half way up the loch the
yacht came to anchor, and a boat was lowered to convey
the passengers ashore.</p>

<p>“But, Craven,” said Mrs. Black wonderingly, “I see
no house.”</p>

<p>“Look half way up the mountain side,” said her husband,
pointing with his finger. “Do you see that broad
ledge set thick with black looking trees, firs, larches and
mountain pines? Back of the ledge, at a distance of
half a mile, rises the high mountain peak. Well, on
that wild looking ledge, perched in mid-air, as one
might say, an outlaw ancestor of mine who fought on
the losing side in one of the Scottish wars, and was compelled
to flee for his life, built an outlaw’s den, in which<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
he spent his last years and finally died. The house has
since been improved and enlarged—”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Craven,” interrupted Octavia, “the
Wilderness cannot be upon that ledge, up this steep pile
of rocks. Why, the ledge is inaccessible, unless to yonder
eagle. We cannot get up there without wings.”</p>

<p>“You comprehend why I could never let nor sell the
place,” said Craven Black. “But we can get up the
cliff. There is a narrow footpath, not especially dangerous,
but rather fatiguing. The men will bring up
the luggage, and we will walk up. The boat is ready.
Come.”</p>

<p>He assisted his wife into the boat, and then Neva.
The maid came next. Dressing bags followed. Mr.
Black sprang in, and two of the sailors pulled lustily for
the shore.</p>

<p>The passengers were landed at a projecting rock at
the water’s edge, and Craven Black, ordering the seamen
to remain where they were until he should send a
servant to them, conducted his wife, Neva and the maid,
by a narrow, steep and tortuous path, up the precipitous
face of the cliff. The dreary night fell before they had
gained the ledge, but the soft moonlight flecked their
path with gleams of brightness, and at last they stood
upon the ledge, high up among the mountains, with the
loch lying like a tarnished jewel far below at their feet.</p>

<p>“We are buried alive here, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>!” gasped the
little French woman, staring around her. “We are in a
tomb!”</p>

<p>Neva’s heart echoed the words.</p>

<p>The wide plateau, with its thickly growing trees on
every side, looked very grim in the moonlight, obscured
as that light was by the towering, frowning mountains.
In the midst of the plateau stood an old stone house,
long and low, and hideously ugly in its proportions,<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
having a frowning and grim appearance well in keeping
with its surroundings.</p>

<p>The front door of this house was opened, and lights
gleamed from the windows, and forms were seen hovering
near the dwelling in watchful expectation.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we were expected!” said Neva, in
surprise. “The house is not closed, as you said, Mr.
Black!”</p>

<p>Octavia Black laughed with a strange, mocking
cadence that struck a chill to Neva’s heart.</p>

<p>“Give Neva your arm, my dear,” she said gayly.
“What an idea of yours that we are expected, Neva!
Why, we only decided to come while we were on the
sea. I am nearly famished, and hope some one will prepare
supper for us and give us something better than
oatmeal.”</p>

<p>As the new-comers drew near the house, the forms
Neva had seen disappeared. The travelers ascended the
single step to the low broad porch, and entered the wide
hall of the dwelling. This hall was lighted by a lantern
suspended from the ceiling, and had a stone floor, a
stone staircase, and doors upon each side opening into
the living rooms of the house.</p>

<p>The travelers halted in the midst of the hall, and at
the same moment the parlor door opened, and a woman
came out with smiles of welcome—a woman clad in
bright-colored garments, but with ash-colored hair and
complexion.</p>

<p>This woman was Mrs. Artress!</p>

<p>Neva recognized her with a sudden horror. She knew
in that instant that her visit to the Wilderness had been
pre-arranged by her enemies—that her wildest suspicions
of the falseness and perfidy of Octavia Black
had fallen short of the truth—that she had been snared
in a trap—that she was a prisoner!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HOW LALLY TOOK HER DEPARTURE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The composed and defiant announcement by Mrs.
Wroat that she had adopted Lally Bird as her daughter
and heiress, was like a bombshell flung into the enemy’s
camp. Mrs. Blight stood as if turning to stone, in an
utter panic, her eyes glaring upon Mrs. Wroat and upon
Lally alternately, her chest heaving, her face livid. All
her fine schemes of future grandeur became in an instant
“airy visions fading into nothingness.” She beheld herself
and her family upon the brink of insolvency, which
this old lady’s fortune might have averted. She was
convulsed with rage and amazement, and with bitter
hatred of her young governess.</p>

<p>What she might have done or said cannot be known,
for Peters, desiring to spare her aged mistress a scene
and expected reproaches, pushed the bank-notes she
held into Mrs. Blight’s hand, and taking her by the arm,
gently forced her out into the hall and closed the door
upon her.</p>

<p>This last indignity was too much for the disappointed
woman. With a wild shriek, she fled precipitately down
the stairs, and burst into the drawing-room and into her
husband’s presence like an incarnate whirlwind. And
here flinging herself into a chair, she gave way to a burst
of hysterics as violent as terrifying.</p>

<p>The first act of Mr. Blight was to deluge his wife with
the contents of a carafe of water which happened to be
at hand. Then bending over her and chafing her hands,
he adjured her to tell him what was the matter, and if
the children were all killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“You—you beast!” gasped the wife, with the tones
and breathing of a drowning woman. “You’ve ruined
my new dress, and it cost fifteen shillings a yard, if it
cost a penny! The dear knows where I am to get
another. I expect to find myself in the union by this
time next year, on account of that treacherous viper that
I warmed in my bosom! Oh, my poor children—my
poor ruined lambs!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Laura?” demanded her husband
impatiently. “Don’t be a fool, if you can help it, for
once. What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Everything has happened!” wailed Mrs. Blight.
“We are wretched, good-for-nothing beggars. The old
wretch up stairs has gone and left all her money to that
jade of a governess—”</p>

<p>“Speak sense, if you can. What do you mean, I ask
again? How can Aunt Wroat have ‘gone and left all
her money’ to Miss Bird? Is your mind wandering?”</p>

<p>“No, I wish it was. I’d rather be a wild maniac of
Bedlam than what I am at this moment,” moaned the
unhappy lawyer’s wife. “My governess, Miss Bird, you
know, is hob-nobbing with Aunt Wroat; and who do
you think the artful minx has turned out to be? Why,
she says she’s the daughter of Clara Percy, who married
a corn-chandler—the very girl that Aunt Wroat has
been looking for for over a year. And Aunt Wroat has
adopted her, and says the girl is to inherit every penny
of her fifty thousand pounds, except money enough to
buy you and me each a penny whistle, or some such
thing. And the girl is to have all of Aunt Wroat’s
splendid diamonds. O dear! O dear! What is life
but a trial? Why was I born?”</p>

<p>“But this is infamous!” gasped the lawyer. “It’s
preposterous. The girl’s an impostor. Why didn’t you
tell Aunt Wroat so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I did—I did. But she sneered at me—she did, indeed.
And here is the five pounds I advanced the girl,
and Aunt Wroat paid it back to me. And here is
twenty pounds for the expenses we’ve been put to on
Aunt Wroat’s account. They made me take it. But
what can pay us for our blighted hopes? The girl
ought to be arrested. If I were only a judge I’d send
her to Botany Bay!”</p>

<p>“Serves you right for taking the jade in! And so
she’s the daughter of Clara Percy. I thought her name
seemed familiar,” said the lawyer. “Aunt Wroat was
always uttering that name on her visit to us last year.
What fatality!”</p>

<p>“Must we give up in this way?” sobbed Mrs. Blight.
“Is there nothing we can do?”</p>

<p>The lawyer paced the floor excitedly, his features
working. Suddenly he paused before his wife, and said
in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Are you sure the girl is honest?”</p>

<p>“As sure as that I am—the treacherous cat!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Laura, that she hasn’t stolen something
of yours—a jewel, a bit of lace, or a trinket?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure,” answered the obtuse Mrs. Blight.
“She’s had no chance to take anything of mine since she
came into this house. Ellen’s been sewing in my bedroom
every day from morning till night.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure—”</p>

<p>“You’re worse than the solicitor-general in the Tichborne
case, with that eternal repetition,” snapped Mrs.
Blight angrily. “‘Would you be surprised to hear?’—‘Are
you sure?’—I’m not sure of anything, Charles, except
that we are lost, ruined, and undone. Yes, I am
sure that what you’re thinking of can’t be done. I won’t
be dragged into court; I won’t swear to a lie, for I’d be
sure to be caught. I won’t be publicly disgraced in an<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
attempt to ruin the girl. We shouldn’t deceive Aunt
Wroat, and she’d get a keener lawyer than you are to
turn you and me inside out.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell all that to the whole house, servants
included,” exclaimed Mr. Blight. “Our game is
up, unless this girl is got rid of. We can turn her out
of the house to-night, and that we will do. But, first of
all, we will go up stairs and argue the case with Aunt
Wroat.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you all,” said Mrs. Blight, still weeping.
“Aunt Wroat is not deaf at all, and heard you call
her an old cat, and an old nuisance.”</p>

<p>“It was you called her so!”</p>

<p>“It was you! Of course, if we are ruined you’ll lay
all the blame on me. Men are all alike, from Adam
down. It’s always the woman did it. The idea of her
pretending to be deaf and listening to what we said!
It’ll do no good to go up stairs to talk with Aunt Wroat,
but I’ll make a last effort for the sake of my dear children.”</p>

<p>The well-mated pair went up to the door of Mrs.
<a id="Ref_72" href="#BRef_72">Wroat’s</a> chamber, and knocked loudly for admittance.
Peters replied to them through the key-hole:</p>

<p>“My mistress desires to be excused. She can bear no
more excitement to-night. Besides, she is occupied with
her niece.”</p>

<p>The lawyer tried the door fiercely: it was locked.
Then he stooped, applying his mouth to the key-hole.</p>

<p>“Tell your mistress,” he said, in a sort of roar, “that
that girl is an impostor, and no more her niece than she’s
her grandfather. The girl is deceiving her—”</p>

<p>He paused discomfited as he heard the old lady hobble
away into the inner room, followed by Lally.</p>

<p>“You’d better go down stairs,” advised Peters, through
the medium Mr. Blight had employed. “May be you<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
don’t know you are laying yourself liable to a suit for
slander.”</p>

<p>“We had better go down,” said the lawyer. “The
servants are collecting on the basement stairs to learn
the cause of the hubbub. We’ll see Aunt Wroat in the
morning, and convince her that she’s been taken in by
a clever adventuress, but the girl goes to-night.”</p>

<p>With this resolve the couple returned to the drawing-room,
leaving the door ajar that they might hear Lally’s
return to her room. They waited hours, but they did
not hear it. The servants retired to bed, and the clocks
through the house struck twelve, and still Lally did not
emerge from Mrs. Wroat’s room. The Blights crept up
again to their visitor’s door, but silence reigned within.</p>

<p>“The old thing has gone to sleep,” murmured Mrs.
Blight. “I can hear that odious Peters breathing. Perhaps
the girl has slipped to her room so silently that we
did not hear her.”</p>

<p>They stole up to the third floor to see. They found
Lally’s room empty and dark.</p>

<p>“They’ve outwitted us,” said Mr. Blight, with an oath.
“The girl is going to sleep with the old woman to-night.
By George, I wish the old creature would die in her
sleep. I’d have the girl arrested for her murder. We
may as well go to bed, Laura. We must be up early in
the morning.”</p>

<p>They retired to their room, but we may safely assert
that they did not sleep. They lamented the failure of
their plans, accused each other of ruining their mutual
prospects and the prospects of their children, and arose
soon after daybreak, imbittered, angry, and full of rage
and bitterness.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock they heard Lally come forth from
Mrs. Wroat’s chamber and go up to her room. The
young governess had slept with her aged kinswoman,<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
and now, by Mrs. Wroat’s command, was about to pack
her few effects in her box, ready for departure.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Blight followed Lally to her room, and
entered, without knocking.</p>

<p>The girl was busy, folding her garments, and her round
gipsy face was all aglow, her black eyes had in them a
look of hopefulness of late a stranger to them, and she
was altogether changed from the piteously sorrowful
young creature of the day before. Even the love of her
eccentric kinswoman had served to kindle the spark of
new hopes and new interests in Lally’s lonely life. She
regarded her visitors with something of surprise, but
received them courteously.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, madam; good-morning, sir,” she said,
bowing. “Will you be seated?”</p>

<p>“Viper! Ingrate!” cried Mrs. Blight theatrically, but
with genuine anger. “I warmed you in my bosom, as
it were; I fed you at my table; I paid you at the rate
of twenty pounds a year; and this is the way you reward
me! Serpent! Base serpent!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, madam. What is it I have
done?”</p>

<p>“Hear her!” cried Mrs. Blight, her hands uplifted,
apostrophizing the ceiling. “She asks what she has
done!” and the lady’s tones grew hysterical. “She has
taken the bread from my children’s mouths! She has
made me a beggar! She has traduced us and lied about
us, and now asks us what she has done!”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Lally, her black eyes flashing, “I have
not traduced you, nor lied about you.”</p>

<p>“You have repeated to Mrs. Wroat my unguarded remarks
about her, made to you in confidence.”</p>

<p>“Again you are mistaken, madam,” said Lally sternly.
“I have not repeated those remarks. Mrs. Wroat judged
you by words she herself overheard. I have done nothing<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
to injure you, nor is it my fault that my great-aunt
has chosen to exalt me at your expense. Believe me,
Mrs. Blight, if my aunt had not found me, she would
not have left her money to you.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt?” cried the lawyer. “Seems to me you
are getting along fast, young woman. Your aunt, eh?
It is my opinion that you are a clever adventuress, and I
deem it my duty to protect my dear aunt from your evil
machinations. Put your things into that trunk. Laura,
ring the hall bell for Buttons.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight complied. Buttons made his appearance.</p>

<p>“Take that trunk down to the street, and call a cab,”
commanded Mr. Blight.</p>

<p>The trunk being locked with a spring catch, Buttons
shouldered it and vanished down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss,” said the lawyer, with vindictive triumph,
“you must be off. You cannot be allowed to speak
again to the infirm old lady you have persecuted. March
down the stairs quietly, or I’ll call a policeman and accuse
you of stealing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blight—”</p>

<p>“Not a word, Miss. On with your bonnet and shawl,
and depart. One word to arouse Mrs. Wroat, and I’ll
have you dragged off to jail.”</p>

<p>The color went in and out of the girl’s cheeks, and she
was frightened and confused. Her situation seemed to
her indeed terrible. Peters had confided to her during
the previous night, while Mrs. Wroat slept, that the old
lady, in addition to her pulmonary disease, had an affection
of the heart, and her physician had declared that she
must not be unnecessarily excited, for excitement might
prove dangerous to her. The excitement of finding her
great-niece for whom she had so long sought had been
almost too much for her, and Lally feared to disturb her
further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“You need not lay your hands upon me, Mr. Blight,”
said the young girl, drawing herself away from his
touch. “I will go from your house, as you command—but
don’t touch me!”</p>

<p>She hastened down the stairs, followed by her late employers,
and paused for a second in the lower hall with
her gaze fixed upon Mrs. Wroat’s door. But the door
did not open, and she went on and came into the yard.
The garden door was open, and a cab stood in front of
it, Lally’s box already mounted upon its roof.</p>

<p>“Where shall I tell the cabby to go, Miss?” asked
the lawyer, ushering Lally into the street, and laying
hold of the cab door. “Get in,” he added fiercely, in an
under tone, “or I’ll send for a policeman!”</p>

<p>Lally climbed into the cab, not answering. “To the railway
station,” said the lawyer, closing the door softly.</p>

<p>The cab rolled down the street. The Blights, triumphant,
reentered their villa.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it right with the old woman,” muttered the
lawyer, rubbing his hands. “I’ll tell her the girl has
run off, after acknowledging that she was an impostor, and
that her real name is Jones. Come in, Laura. We’re
not quite ruined yet.”</p>

<p>If he was not quite ruined, he was certainly nearer
ruin than he thought. Astute as he believed himself, he
had not quite understood the young lady with whom he
had to deal. Lally had not gone a block down the street,
when she lowered the front window of the cab, and
quietly touched the driver’s arm.</p>

<p>“We’ll go back to Sandy Lands,” she said, in a tone
of command. “I have no money with me.”</p>

<p>“Forgot your purse, hey?” said the driver. “All right,
Miss.”</p>

<p>He turned and drove back.</p>

<p>Lally commanded him to halt in the middle of the<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
road, in full view of the front windows of the villa. The
parlor of Mrs. Wroat faced the street. The inside blinds
were raised, and Lally gazed up at the windows expectantly.</p>

<p>“Could you throw a pebble to hit those upper windows,
driver?” she asked, of the puzzled cabman.</p>

<p>“Doubtful, Miss. Might break the glass, and have a
big bill to pay. Is there somebody up stairs there you
want to call?”</p>

<p>Lally nodded.</p>

<p>The cabman glanced up and down the street; there
was no policeman to be seen; and he then gave utterance
to such a yell as brought to the window not only
Mrs. Wroat and Peters, but Mr. and Mrs. Blight at the
drawing-room windows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat at the upper window saw Lally, the cab,
and the box upon it, and comprehended what had occurred.
Peters threw up the sash.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, cabby,” said the old lady, leaning
from the window, and speaking shrilly. “There’s two
more of us, and a parrot and a dog and plenty of luggage.
I’ll give you double fare, cabby—wait!”</p>

<p>She disappeared, just as the lawyer bounded out of
the house to order the cabman away. That worthy,
obeying Lally’s command, stood his ground, and offered
to fight the lawyer if he received “any more of his
sarce.” Mr. Blight retreated with his wife, and hurried
up to Mrs. Wroat’s chambers. He met her hobbling out
of her room leaning upon the arm of the faithful Peters,
who was laden with the parrot’s cage, the bandbox and
umbrella, and was followed by the dog. This latter
immediately conceived a desire to nip the lawyer’s legs,
and Mr. Blight was obliged to keep up a very undignified
dance to avoid him, while he addressed the old<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
lady in terms of expostulation and entreaty, heaping
vituperations upon Lally.</p>

<p>“Send my trunks down, and be lively,” said Mrs.
Wroat, paying no heed to his words. “Don’t act like a
Dancing Jack, or your friends will put you in Bedlam,
Blight. Come, Peters, Mr. Blight has kindly ordered a
cab for us, and we must be off. If we’re lively, we can
catch the up express.”</p>

<p>She brushed past the Blights, husband and wife, the
latter weeping and pleading, and descended into the
yard. The cabman was induced to go up after her baggage,
the exhibition of a half-crown lending him wonderful
strength and alacrity, and the cab was soon
piled high with luggage. Mrs. Wroat, Lally and Peters
took their places inside, the driver mounted, and just
then the Blights, resolved upon a last despairing effort
to gain the fleeting fifty thousand pounds, came out to
the garden door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat bowed to them mockingly, and said as she
waved her hand, with glowing exultation, her eyes snapping:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. and Mrs. Blight. My daughter and
I will breakfast at the station, and dine at our house in
town. My Blighted friends, if you are ever in need,
write to my heiress, and I dare say she will send you a
half-crown. Driver, to the railway station.”</p>

<p>The cab with its occupants rolled away in triumph.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LALLY’S NEW EXISTENCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After their triumphant departure from Sandy Lands,
and from the presence of the utterly discomfited Mr.
and Mrs. Blight, Mrs. Wroat, accompanied by Lally,
and attended by the faithful Peters, proceeded without
molestation to the Canterbury railway station. The up
express was due in some ten minutes, and Mrs. Peters
found opportunity to send a telegraphic message to Mrs.
Wroat’s housekeeper in town announcing the immediate
return of her mistress with a young lady guest, and
ordering that suitable preparations be made for their
reception.</p>

<p>This duty had scarcely been fulfilled, when the train
came puffing into the station, and the party took their
seats in a first-class coach, securing a compartment to
themselves.</p>

<p>On alighting at the London station Peters procured a
cab.</p>

<p>“This is my last journey, Peters,” sighed Mrs. Wroat,
leaning back her head, as the cab rolled out of the station
and into the streets. “My traveling days end here!”</p>

<p>“So you always say, ma’am,” said Peters cheerfully.
“But you’ve no call to travel any more. You’ve found
what you’ve been searching for so long,” and she
glanced at Lally. “You should stay at home now and
take comfort.”</p>

<p>“The end is near!” sighed the old lady—“very near!”</p>

<p>Peters and Lally looked at the old lady with a sudden
keenness of vision. Her hooked nose and pointed chin
seemed sharper than usual. Her black eyes were more<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
piercing and lustrous than was their wont; her features
were pinched; and over all her face was spread an
ominous gray pallor that told to the experienced eyes of
Peters that the diseased heart was not properly performing
its functions.</p>

<p>Peters turned and looked from the window with tears
in her eyes. Her heart echoed those sad words: “The
end is near!”</p>

<p>In due time the cab came to a halt in Mount street,
Grosvenor Square, before the stately and somewhat old-fashioned
mansion which had been the home of Mrs.
Wroat for more than half a century. It was a double
house, with parlors on either side of a wide hall, and
was built of brick with stone copings and lintels, and
possessed a pretentious flight of steps guarded by stone
lions, and a great oriel window projecting from the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>The front door of this house opened as the cab drew
up, and a footman and a boy came down the steps and
assisted their aged mistress to alight and enter the house.
Lally and Peters came after, and Mrs. Wroat was taken
to her own room, one of the rear parlors on the first
floor, which she had appropriated twenty years before
as her bed-chamber.</p>

<p>Out of doors the September air was mild, but in this
room of Mrs. Wroat a sea-coal fire was burning in the
grate, and its genial heat in that great house was not
unpleasant. A crimson carpet covered the floor; crimson
damask curtains half draped the wide windows that
looked out upon a small square garden; and crimson-hued
easy chairs and couches were scattered about the
room in profusion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat sank down upon one of the couches, and
Peters bent over her, removing her huge scuttle-shaped
bonnet and her Indian shawl. The footman and the<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
boy were bringing in the luggage. Lally stood apart,
not knowing what to do, when the housekeeper, an
elderly, plain-featured Scottish woman, appeared. Mrs.
Wroat beckoned the woman to come nearer to her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dougal,” she said, in a clear, loud voice, and
looking affectionately at the slender, black-robed figure
of Lally, “I have brought home with me my great-niece,
Miss Lalla Bird, who is also my adopted daughter and
heiress. I desire you to consider her as your future
mistress.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dougal bowed low to the young lady, and Mrs.
Wroat continued:</p>

<p>“Let the best room in the house be prepared for her
use, Mrs. Dougal—the amber room. Ah, it is ready!
Show Miss Bird to it then, and see that her trunk is
sent up to her. And have luncheon ready for us in half
an hour or less, Mrs. Dougal. We are nearly famished.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper again bowed, and conducted Lally
into the hall and up the broad stairs to a front chamber,
one of the state apartments of the house. Here, soon
after, she left the young girl to renovate her toilet, going
again to her aged mistress.</p>

<p>“This is a wonderful change for me!” murmured
Lally. “I must be dreaming. So lately I slept in a
barn with tramps and thieves, glad of even that shelter,
and now I am housed in a palace. I am afraid I shall
wake up presently to find myself in the barn. Ah, I
never even dreamed of such magnificence!”</p>

<p>She examined her surroundings with the delighted
curiosity of a child. There was a fire behind the silvered
bars of the low, wide grate, and its red gleams streamed
out over the rich blue velvet carpet with its bordering of
amber arabesques on a blue ground, and one long red
spike of dancing light fell upon the amber silk curtains
of the low canopied bedstead. The square pillows were<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
covered with the daintiest of linen, frilled with real lace.
The coverlet was of amber satin, embroidered with a
great medallion in blue silk. The curtains were of amber
satin, with blue fringe, over white lace drapery, and the
couches and chairs were upholstered in amber relieved
with blue.</p>

<p>Lally observed two doors at one side of the room, and
crossing the floor softly, she opened them successively.
The first door opened upon a large and handsomely fitted
bath-room, with marble basin and marble floor, half
covered by a Turkish rug. The other door opened into
a beautiful little dressing-room, furnished to match the
bed-chamber. A massive armoire of carved ebony, with
doors formed of plate-glass mirrors, completely covered
one side of the wall, and a long swing mirror, framed in
ebony, stood opposite. A gasolier depended from the
middle of the ornate ceiling, and in three of the globes
a mellow light was burning.</p>

<p>“It is like fairy-land!” thought the girl. “All this
for me—for me! I can hardly believe it.”</p>

<p>There were ivory-handled brushes on the low dressing
bureau, and Lally handled them carefully, almost afraid
to use them. Her poor garments seemed out of place in
these beautiful rooms, but she had no better dress, and
with a smothered sigh she bathed her face and hands in
the bath-room, and brushed her hair and dress in the
dressing-room. She tied anew the bow in her hair and
her black sash, and her toilet was complete. She gave
a last look to her new quarters, and hastened down stairs
to the chamber of her benefactress.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Wroat comfortably ensconced in an
easy chair by her fire. The parrot’s cage swung by a
stout silver chain from the ceiling; the ugly little dog lay
dozing upon a cushion near the fender; and a general
atmosphere of delicious warmth and coziness prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>“Come here, my dear, and kiss me,” said Mrs. Wroat,
not looking around, but recognizing Lally’s step.</p>

<p>The girl obeyed, and sat down upon a stool at the old
lady’s feet. Mrs. Wroat smiled upon her and talked to
her, and when Peters came in, announcing that luncheon
waited, Lally and her great-aunt were in the midst of a
confidential talk, and their friendship had already deepened
into a mutual affection.</p>

<p>Luncheon was served in the dining-room, across the
hall from Mrs. Wroat’s chamber. The windows of the
dining-room opened into a small conservatory overlooking
the garden, and the room itself, lofty and handsome,
seemed to Lally the realization of one of her long-ago
girlish dreams. Mrs. Wroat sat at one end of the oval
table, Peters at the other, and Lally took a place at one
side. The footman waited at table, but was soon dismissed,
and the three were left to themselves and the enjoyment
of the dainties plentifully displayed before them.</p>

<p>After the luncheon, Peters assisted her aged mistress
back to her own room, Lally lending an arm to the support
of the old lady.</p>

<p>“Ring the bell, Peters,” said Mrs. Wroat, as she again
ensconced herself in her favorite chair. “But stay!
Bring me my little desk. I want to write a note.”</p>

<p>Peters brought a portable malachite writing-desk, and
placed it upon a table before her mistress. Mrs. Wroat,
with an unsteady hand, penned a brief note to her lawyer,
demanding his immediate attendance upon her, upon
a matter of the utmost moment.</p>

<p>“Read it, Peters,” she said, when she had appended
her name and the date. “It must be sent immediately.
I feel, somehow, as if I had no time to waste. Let the
footman take the letter to Mr. Harris and wait for an
answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>Peters read and sealed the missive, removed the desk
and went out upon her errand.</p>

<p>Some two hours later, Mr. Harris, Mrs. Wroat’s lawyer,
arrived and was shown into the old lady’s presence.
He was an old man, sharp-witted, business-like, and
reticent, but honest, kindly, and devoted to the interests
of his client, whose personal friend he had been for over
a third of a century.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wroat welcomed him with outstretched hands
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My friend, I have a surprise for you. You have
sought, at my request, for my great-niece, Lally Bird,
and failed to find her, even with a detective officer to
assist you. I am neither lawyer nor detective, but I am
more clever than you both. <em>I</em> have found my niece, and
here she is. Lally, come nearer. Mr. Harris, this is
Lally Bird, the daughter of my niece Clara Percy.”</p>

<p>Lally bowed. Mr. Harris stared at the girl in surprise.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Wroat,” he exclaimed, “but
your great-niece, Lally Bird, is dead. Our detective
discovered the facts some weeks ago, but I feared to
communicate them in your present state of health. I
cannot, however, permit you to be imposed upon by a
possible adventuress. Miss Lally Bird committed suicide
last July. She sprang from London Bridge, and
struck upon a passing boat, killing her instantly. I have
a newspaper in my pocket—”</p>

<p>“Never mind your paper,” interrupted Mrs. Wroat
vivaciously. “Look at the girl. Has she not my black
eyes? Can you not remember when I had hair like hers,
and that dear olive skin? You are too suspicious, my
friend. Where do you suppose I found her? Why,
down at Blight’s, at Canterbury. She was governess to
the Blight children. Now sit down, and I’ll tell you the
whole story. Stay, I am tired, and Lally will tell it.<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
Question her, and be convinced of the truth of my assertions.
Sit down, Lally, dear, and tell Mr. Harris all
about yourself.”</p>

<p>Lally sat down near her great-aunt. She was a little
frightened under the searching gaze of the lawyer, but
her clear honest eyes met his unflinchingly, and he read
in the sad and innocent face how deeply he had wronged
her in deeming her a “possible adventuress.” He asked
her a few questions in a quiet, careless manner, referring
to a note-book which he produced and then his
professional spirit stirring itself, he cross-questioned
her as if she had been a witness in court whose evidence
he was trying to shake, and upon whose impeachment
the success of his cause depended.</p>

<p>He asked her her name, age, and date of her birth,
and applied the same questions in regard to each of her
deceased parents. He demanded where she had been
educated, how she had maintained herself after her
father’s death, and finally said, in a tone that betrayed
how important the question and its answer was to the
establishment of the girl’s claims:</p>

<p>“I have discovered—Miss Bird—assuming that you
are Miss Bird—that you left your situation as music-teacher,
or, to be more exact, that the school in which
you were engaged closed, and you were thrown out of a
situation, in the spring of this year. Where did you
spend the months that passed between last May and this
present month of September? And how, I may as well
ask here, did your handkerchief happen to be found upon
the water at the precise moment when that poor girl
who was drowned, and who was supposed to be Lally
Bird, was picked up?”</p>

<p>Lally blushed and paled, and looked appealingly at
Mrs. Wroat. The old lady stroked the girl’s black hair
softly, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Harris, you have touched upon a point of which
I, as well as my niece, would have preferred not to
speak. But you are my personal friend, and the confidence
will be safe with you. Lally, tell Mr. Harris your
story.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Lally, with much embarrassment, told
her story with a quiet truthfulness that carried conviction
to the mind of the lawyer; after which, at a sign from
Mrs. Wroat, Lally withdrew with the maid, who soon
returned alone.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old lady briskly, “I want to come to
business. Mr. Harris, I desire to make my will. Have
you the necessary form with you? I want a will as
strong as a will can be made, for the Blights may choose
to question its validity, on the ground that I am infirm,
or something of the sort. Peters, wheel up the writing-table.”</p>

<p>The maid obeyed. Mr. Harris drew from his pocket a
large note-case, from which he extracted a document,
which he silently handed to his aged client.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said, “it is my will, which I requested you,
months ago, to draw up, without date or names, ready for
signature when I should be ready to sign it. It begins
by declaring that I am of sound mind—ah, yes, that is
all right. The property is enumerated, and the legacy
to Peters is down. I must have the annuity to her, to
be paid out of the estate, doubled.”</p>

<p>She read the document carefully and slowly, weighing
every word and sentence. When she had finished, she
gave it back into her lawyer’s hand.</p>

<p>“Write in the name of the legatee, Mr. Harris. ‘I
give and bequeath all my real estate, bank-stock, consols
and personal property to my great-niece Lalla Bird.’
Make it plain and strong, so that no one but Lally can
get my money. I want the property settled upon her.<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
She may marry some day, if her first marriage was no
marriage at all. I’ll discuss that first marriage with you
at some future time, for I want to know whether the
child is bound or not. But no husband must have power
to squander Lally’s money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harris did as he was directed, making out the will
to the perfect satisfaction of Mrs. Wroat. Peters, at the
command of her mistress, called up the household, and
in the presence of the housekeeper, the house-maid, the
cook and the footman, Mrs. Wroat signed the will. The
domestics appended their signatures as witnesses, and
were then dismissed; Lally was called back to her great-aunt,
and soon after the lawyer took his leave.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Wroat was so much better that she
insisted on going out with her young relative upon
a shopping excursion. She presented Lally with a silver
portmonnaie, filled with bank-notes, and early in the
day Mrs. Wroat, Lally and Peters went out in the
ancient family carriage, visiting the most celebrated
shops in the West End. The old lady did not permit
Lally to expend the money she had given her, but
bought, and paid for from her own plethoric pocket-book,
a magnificent Indian shawl, jewels, rich and costly
laces, a set of Russian sables, a dressing-case with gold
fittings, odor cases, a jewel case, and a host of costly
luxuries of which Lally knew neither the uses nor the
names.</p>

<p>“Why do you buy an Indian shawl for so young a lady,
ma’am?” whispered Peters, in surprise. “And why buy
those costly furs in September?”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be here when the cold weather comes,
Peters,” answered Mrs. Wroat, in a low voice. “And
though I have Indian shawls which she will inherit, I
want to buy her one for her own self. She will keep it
always, because I bought it for her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>Lally, as may be supposed, was grateful for her aunt’s
kindnesses; she was more than grateful. But in the
midst of her pleasure, a pang shot to her heart. She
noticed that although this aged relative bought her an
abundance of all standard articles, and toilet appurtenances,
and dainty personal belongings, she bought but
few dresses—a token that she expected Lally soon to put
on a mourning garb.</p>

<p>After a visit to the ladies’ outfitter, where Mrs. Wroat
purchased for Lally a trousseau fit for a wealthy bride,
they returned to Mount street, and to dinner.</p>

<p>The next fortnight passed swiftly both to Lally and
her great-aunt. The health of the latter seemed to improve,
and Lally and Peters entertained high hopes that
their kind friend and benefactress would live many years.
The old lady’s physician contracted the habit of calling
in daily, but even Mrs. Wroat smiled at his anxiety, and
accused him of desiring to increase his fees at her expense
without just cause.</p>

<p>These two weeks sufficed to knit the souls of Lally and
her aged relative together in a bond which time alone
could sever. They grew to entertain a mutual love,
which would be to the survivor a sweet and tender memory
while life should endure. Lally’s experiences had
been very bitter, and she had thought she should never
smile again, yet in her aunt’s society she felt a great degree
of actual happiness, and waited upon her, and tended
her, with the care and love of a daughter. She played
and sang to her; she read to her; she listened with keen
interest to the old lady’s tales of her youth; and soon
Mrs. Wroat was heard to wonder many times each day
how she had so long existed without her bright young
niece; and Peters grew to love Lally with a protecting
tenderness.</p>

<p>During this fortnight, which passed so happily in the<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
great old mansion in Mount street, Mr. Harris had traced
out Lally’s history step by step from the hour of her
birth until the present moment, not that he doubted her,
but that he desired to be supplied with irrefragable
proofs of her identity, should the need arise for them.</p>

<p>The lapse of the fortnight indicated brought the time
to October. One evening, when the night was wild
without, Mrs. Wroat, Lally and Peters sat late in the
parlor adjoining the bedroom of the former. Lally
played and sang a grand old anthem, while the old lady’s
crooked chin was bent forward upon her gold-headed
staff, and her bright black eyes filled with tears. Then
followed some old-time hymns, such as the Covenanters
sang in the lonely Scottish wilds, in their hours of stolen
secret worship. When the sweet voice had died away,
and the strains of music melted into silence, the old lady
called Lally to her. The girl came, and seeing the unwonted
emotion of her aged relative, knelt before her
and caressed her hand softly. The withered yellow hands
were upraised tremblingly, and dropped upon the girl’s
dusky head.</p>

<p>“God bless you, even as I bless you, my darling,” said
Mrs. Wroat, with a great yearning over the young creature.
“Poor orphaned child! You have blessed my last
days; may your life be blessed. Peters, when I am gone,
stay with Lally. Be everything to her—maid, attendant,
nurse, mother—all that you have been to me.”</p>

<p>“I will—I will!” said Peters, as if registering a vow.</p>

<p>“And now, my darling, good-night,” said Mrs. Wroat
softly. “Kiss me, Lally! Again! Again! Good-night.”</p>

<p>The girl enfolded the withered form in her arms, and
kissed the old lady a hundred times with passionate
fervor, and then, sobbing, went up to her own room.</p>

<p>Peters put her mistress to bed. The old lady seemed<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
as well, or better than usual, but there was something
unusual in her manner, and Peters sat up to watch by
her.</p>

<p>“If she wakes, she’ll find old Peters by her side,” the
woman said to herself. “How sweet she sleeps!”</p>

<p>Toward morning the maid dozed. Just at dawn she
awakened with a great start, and a sudden chill. She
sprang up and leaned over the recumbent figure of her
mistress. How pale the thin, sharp features were! One
long lock of gray hair lay on the withered cheek; the
bony hands were clasped upon the bosom; the hooked
nose and the crooked chin almost met, but upon the
shrivelled mouth was a smile far more sweet and lovely
than any that had played upon those lips in the old
lady’s far-past youth—a smile such as angels wear!</p>

<p>Peters thrust her hand upon the sleeper’s heart. It
was silent. The heart, clogged or hampered by disease,
had ceased to work hours before; all the machinery of
life had stopped; and Mrs. Wroat had wakened from
her sleep in another world! Lally’s generous and noble
friend and protector was dead!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SURPRISE FOR MISS WYNDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Neva Wynde, on finding herself confronted by
Artress at the very door of Mr. Black’s wild Highland
retreat, comprehended in one swift flash that she had
been betrayed by her enemies, and caught in a snare, as
we have said—that, in short, she was virtually their
prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>But after her first wild start of amazement, after the
first wild glance at her enemies, she sternly repressed all
signs of terror or surprise, and although her pure, proud
face was paler than usual, yet she did not otherwise betray
her fears.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Artress here!” she said. “This is a surprise.
You said, Mrs. Black, that she was staying with friends
in London, did you not?”</p>

<p>An evil smile played about the full sensual lips of
Octavia Black, and she looked at Neva keenly as she
answered, with affected carelessness:</p>

<p>“I did say so, I believe. But I intended to surprise
you. You are so fond of Mrs. Artress, Neva, that I
wished her to be of our party. I am glad you are so
pleased.”</p>

<p>Neva did not reply, but she drew up her slight figure
with a sudden haughtiness, and her pale, proud face
wore an expression of sternness before which Mrs. Black
ought to have quailed. But Octavia only laughed, and
as Neva thought, mockingly.</p>

<p>“Come into the drawing-room, good people,” cried
Mrs. Artress. “I have made the house habitable, and
I want you to compliment me upon my handiwork.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black went into the room, and Neva followed
her, Craven Black coming last like a body-guard. Neva
had an uncomfortable feeling that she was already a
prisoner.</p>

<p>The drawing-room at the Wilderness was a long barrack-like
apartment, with bare white walls, upon which
were hung a few engravings. The furniture was old,
but well kept, being a combination of mahogany and
black haircloth. The six windows were curtained with
faded damask of the color of mahogany, and an old book-case,
containing a few old and worn volumes, completed
the list of furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a perfect old barrack, Craven!” said Mrs. Black,
with a shudder. “But I suppose it must be fearfully
difficult to get furniture and such things up the cliff.
However, if we make a shooting box of this place, decent
furniture and pictures and things have got to be brought
here. This room is like a draughty old barn.”</p>

<p>“So is the whole house,” said Mrs. Artress. “But the
place is so delightfully romantic, and secluded and hidden,
you know, that one can put up with drawbacks. I
have had my hands full, I assure you, since I arrived
here. How do you like the Wilderness, Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>“It is romantic and secluded, as you say, Mrs. Artress,”
answered Neva quietly, yet with a shade of
hauteur. “Have you been here long?”</p>

<p>“I came direct from Hawkhurst, stopping only a day
in London,” said Mrs. Artress. “I came by rail to Inverness,
and there I chartered a fishing smack and loaded
her with provisions and furniture, and bed and table-linen,
and whatever else I fancied we were likely to need
during our stay here. I had visited the Wilderness once
when I was a girl, and knew about what we should require.
I came on, sent away the sloop, and put the
house in order. I have two women servants in the house,
of the stolidest possible description. You will find it
next to impossible to make them comprehend your soft
southern tongue, Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p>Neva wondered if the last sentence contained a hidden
meaning.</p>

<p>“It is September at Hawkhurst,” continued Mrs. Artress,
with a shiver, “but here one might swear it was
January, the mountain air is so cold. Will you go up
to your rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Mrs. Black. “When do we dine?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Artress consulted a tiny jewelled watch, one of
her recent acquisitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p><a id="Ref_93" href="#BRef_93">“A half</a> an hour,” she said. “You won’t have time
to dress. I’ll send one of the servants down the cliff to
guide up the sailors with the luggage. But first I will
show you to your rooms.”</p>

<p>She passed out into the hall, her train sweeping the
floor with silken rustle. Mrs. Black linked her arm in
Neva’s, but the young girl quietly withdrew her person
from her enemy’s touch, and walked apart proudly, and
with a shade of defiance. Thus they passed up the
wooden stairs, Craven Black bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>The upper part of the house was very simply arranged,
there being a central hall, with chambers opening off it
on either side. At the rear end of the hall was a door
opening upon a flight of steps, beyond which lay the
passage from which the servants’ rooms opened, and from
which the servants’ staircase led down to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“The room at the left is yours, Octavia,” said Mrs.
Artress. “You will find two dressing-rooms attached,
such as they are. The chamber just opposite, here upon
the right, is Miss Wynde’s. Permit me to show you into
your room, Miss Neva.”</p>

<p>She opened a door upon her right, and ushered Neva
into a long ante-room, furnished as a bed-chamber.
Beyond this ante-room, the door open between them,
was a large square bed-room, where candles were burning
in battered silver sconces.</p>

<p>“This ante-room was intended for the use of your
maid,” remarked Mrs. Artress, “but as you did not bring
your maid, and as Celeste is to attend upon you as well
as upon Octavia and me, she may as well occupy your
ante-room. In fact, we are so cramped for habitable
quarters, that I have been compelled to assign it to her.
How do you like your room?”</p>

<p>It was decently furnished, with a new carpet, curtains,
and green roller blinds. There was a wood fire on the<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
broad, old-fashioned hearth. The high-post bedstead,
a modern armed chair and a low chintz-covered couch
were particularly noticeable.</p>

<p>“You have a dressing-room beyond, Miss Wynde,”
said Mrs. Artress, as Neva did not answer, pointing out
a large light closet adjoining the bedroom. “This is a
dear, delightful, out-of-the-world place, is it not?”</p>

<p>Neva deliberately looked into the closet, and surveyed
the walls.</p>

<p>“I see no outlet from this room except through the
ante-room,” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>“There is none. Those queer old-fashioned architects
were very outlandish in their ideas; but then an ante-room
is convenient, my dear—”</p>

<p>Neva checked Mrs. Artress’ familiarity by a haughty
gesture. She had not liked the woman when Mrs. Artress
had been Lady Wynde’s silent and unobtrusive
gray companion, and she liked her still less now that she
had bloomed into a devotee of fashion, and was obtrusively
and offensively familiar and patronizing.</p>

<p>“It strikes me, Mrs. Artress,” she said quietly, “that
the marriage of Lady Wynde to Mr. Black has completely
transformed you. You do not seem like the same
person.”</p>

<p>“And I am not,” declared Mrs. Artress. “There is no
use in keeping the secret any longer, Miss Wynde. The
whole world may know that I am the cousin of Craven
Black, and being his cousin, of course I am his wife’s
equal. I am going into society with Mrs. Craven Black
during the approaching season, and it is quite possible
that I may make as brilliant a marriage as Octavia Hathaway
did when she married Sir Harold Wynde.”</p>

<p>Neva started, those careless words bringing to her
awakening mind a crowd of new and strange suspicions.
She remembered that Mrs. Artress had been in Octavia<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
Hathaway’s employ before the marriage of the latter
with Sir Harold. And Mrs. Artress was Craven Black’s
cousin! Perhaps it was through Mrs. Artress, and after
the death of Sir Harold Wynde in India, that Craven
Black and Lady Wynde had become acquainted? And
perhaps Craven Black had known Octavia Hathaway
before her marriage to Sir Harold Wynde?</p>

<p>The thought—the doubt—was torture to her.</p>

<p>“I had not suspected your relationship to Mr. Black,”
she said coldly; “but I saw, upon the very morning after
Mrs. Black’s marriage, that your relations to her had
changed.”</p>

<p>She longed to ask, directly or indirectly, how long
Octavia had known Craven Black, but her pride would
not permit her to put the question. She turned haughtily
away from Mrs. Artress, signifying by her manner
that she desired to be alone.</p>

<p>The woman’s face reddened, and she turned away with
scarcely smothered anger.</p>

<p>“There is no bell in the room, Miss Wynde,” she said,
halting an instant at the door; “but you will hear the
dinner bell, even in here. There will be a servant in the
hall to show you down to the dining-room.”</p>

<p>She went out, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Neva’s first act, on being left alone, was to examine
the two windows under their roller blinds and chintz
curtains. The windows were of the quaint, old-fashioned
sort, with tiny diamond panes set in heavy divisions of
lead. The windows were casements, opening like doors,
upon hinges, but the lock and fastening were intricate,
and had they not been, it would have been difficult to
open the windows owing to the presence of the inside
blinds and curtains.</p>

<p>And even while Neva was tugging with all her strength
at the cumbrous fastenings, she heard the savage baying<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
of dogs as they chased across the grounds below,
and knew that, whether intentionally or otherwise, her
escape by her windows, should she ever desire to escape
in that manner, would be utterly impracticable.</p>

<p>She retreated from the window and sat down for a
few moments by her fire, thinking.</p>

<p>“It will not do to show suspicion,” she decided at
length. “Perhaps I am alarmed without cause. Why
can my father’s wife, whom my father so loved, desire
to harm me? Is she determined upon my marriage to
Rufus Black? How will such a marriage benefit her?
I acquit Rufus of any share in the conspiracy. They
dared not bring him with them to this place. He would
not permit this oppression and wickedness. Can it be
that my fortune tempts Craven Black and his wife to
force me into a marriage that is repugnant to me, and
that they count upon the weak nature of Rufus, and
that when they get me securely wedded to Rufus, they
will seize upon my income and divert it to their own
use?”</p>

<p>She could not rid herself of this idea, which, as the
reader is aware, approached so nearly to the truth.</p>

<p>“I know that I am in the midst of enemies,” she said
to herself energetically. “There is no use in shutting my
eyes to the truth. The whole truth has come upon me to-night
like a revelation. I must be on my guard, brave
and watchful. I must seem unsuspicious, to throw my
enemies off their guard. How strange it seems that I,
who hate no one, have enemies!”</p>

<p>She arose, not daring to give way further to the suspicions
and anxieties crowding upon her, and brushed
her brown cloth traveling suit and her red-brown hair,
and washed her face and hands. A fresh collar and
cuffs were found in her dressing bag, and she had<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
hardly put them on when the loud clangor of a bell in
the lower hall announced that dinner was ready.</p>

<p>She went through the ante-room into the hall, and
found Celeste, the French maid, waiting to show her
down to the dining-room.</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Neva in French, slipping a gold
coin into the woman’s hand. “How far is the nearest
post-office, Celeste?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen miles across the mountains and lochs, Miss,”
answered the woman, pocketing the coin, with a courtesy.
“There is a village, or hamlet, fifteen miles from
here, but it’s a day’s journey nearly to reach it. It’s
over twenty miles to Inverness, and that is a half day
by water, with a favorable wind, but Inverness is the
family post-office, Miss.”</p>

<p>Neva’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“Could I send a letter to Inverness, do you think?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Miss. The sailors can go in the sloop. Mr.
Black will send them at your bidding, Miss.”</p>

<p>“I prefer a quicker mode,” said Neva, feeling not at
all confident that Mr. Black would accede to such a request
from her. “I desire to write to an old friend of
my father, one of the guardians of my estate—Sir John
Freise. Is there no hanger-on about this place who
would go secretly and swiftly to Inverness for me? If
you can find such a person, I will give him five pounds,
and also give you five pounds, Celeste,” she added, carefully
concealing her anxiety.</p>

<p>“I will do it, Miss,” exclaimed Celeste enthusiastically.
“There is a young man hanging about the kitchen,
a relative of the old cook. I will send him. Write your
letter to-night, Miss Wynde, and I will send it immediately.”</p>

<p>Neva expressed her satisfaction at this arrangement,<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
and descended the stairs to the lower hall, not seeing
the singular gleam in the French woman’s eyes, nor the
treacherous smile on the French woman’s countenance.
Celeste guided her to the dining-room, a large, long,
low room, where Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black and Artress
were already gathered. The three greeted Neva courteously,
and Craven Black came forward to meet her,
and conducted her to her seat at the table.</p>

<p>The dinner consisted of broiled birds upon toast,
vegetables, coffee, crystalized fruits, fresh grapes and
other delicacies, some of which had been brought up
from the yacht. Neva was silent during the meal, and
very thoughtful during the subsequent hour she passed
with her enemies in the drawing-room. At a very early
hour she retired to her own room.</p>

<p>Her luggage had been brought up, and stood unstrapped
in her chamber. Neva closed her door, and
discovered that there was no key in the lock. She pushed
one of her heavy trunks against the door to guard against
surprise, and unlocked another trunk, taking out from
the tray a dispatch box, upon which she proceeded to
write a letter to Sir John Freise.</p>

<p>This was no sooner begun than it was torn up.</p>

<p>“Sir John is too old to be distressed about me,” she
thought. “I will write to Arthur, who must be very
anxious at not hearing from me. He can consult with
Mr. Atkins and Sir John about me if he chooses, or
come for me, as he thinks proper.”</p>

<p>She wrote a long letter to her lover, recounting her
suspicions of Craven Black and his wife, and declaring
that, while she was not locked in her room at the Wilderness,
she nevertheless felt herself a prisoner. She
entreated her lover to come to her, but not to come
alone. She desired him to bring with him either Sir
John or Mr. Atkins, whose support of Lord Towyn’s<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
claims to take her home might be necessary. She declared
that she was afraid, and that she should count
the days until his coming.</p>

<p>Neva sealed and addressed this letter to Lord Towyn,
and then stamping it, stole softly out into the ante-room.
Celeste sat there sewing a frill upon one of her mistress’
robes by the light of candles, but she arose at Neva’s
entrance.</p>

<p>“Celeste,” said the young girl, in a whisper, “here is
my letter. And here are five pounds for the boy, and
five pounds for you,” and she took out two crisp Bank
of England notes from her well-filled pocket-book.
“When I receive the answer to this letter which I expect,
I will give you as much more. You must be very
secret, and let no one see you. Have you spoken to
the boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss, and he has got a rough Highland pony,
and he says he’ll start for Inverness immediately.”</p>

<p>With a feeling of relief, Neva placed the two bank-notes
and the money in the hands of the French woman.</p>

<p>“Go,” she whispered. “And remember, let no one
suspect your errand.”</p>

<p>The French woman assented, and putting the money
and the letter in her pocket, hurried away.</p>

<p>“I am forced to trust her, having no one else to trust,”
said Neva to herself, after a few minutes of reflection.
“Surely she would not take my money and deliberately
betray me? She must know my position, but she cannot
be sure that I know it. The money must tempt her
to be true to me. But will the boy be true? I must
see him—I will see him!”</p>

<p>She acted upon the impulse, going out into the hall,
and softly descending the stairs. Here she paused,
uncertain whether to seek the youth in the kitchen, or
out at the stable. He was more likely to be at the latter<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
place, and she flitted along the hall, pausing abruptly as
a burst of laughter came from the drawing-room, the
door of which was ajar.</p>

<p>She had halted at a point which commanded a view
of the interior of the drawing-room, and involuntarily
she looked in.</p>

<p>The sight she beheld absolutely transfixed her for the
moment.</p>

<p>She beheld Craven Black seated at the centre-table,
under a swinging lamp whose light fell full upon him.
His wife was looking over his shoulder. Mrs. Artress
and the treacherous French woman stood at a little distance,
looking also at Mr. Black. And he—and he—Neva
could scarcely believe the evidence of her senses—he
was reading her letter which she had written to
her lover, and he twirled his waxed mustaches and
uttered little mocking sneers as some especially tender
passage came under his vision.</p>

<p>“By Jove, she’s sweet on Lord Towyn!” he muttered,
with bitter envy, and jealousy, his brows darkening.
“But to go on. ‘Oh, my own Arthur—’”</p>

<p>With the spring of a leopardess, with her soul on fire,
with her wild eyes flaming, with a cry of awful indignation
on her lips, Neva bounded into the room, snatched
the letter from the hands of Craven Black, and retreated
a few steps, clutching it to her bosom, and glaring
around her like some fierce wild creature turned at bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE INAUGURATION OF HOSTILITIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sudden entrance of Neva Wynde into the midst
of her exulting enemies struck them dumb. Craven
Black sat with hands outstretched, as they had grasped
the letter Neva had snatched from them, his face growing
livid, and a look of consternation glaring from his
eyes. Octavia Black stood, half leaning still over her
husband’s shoulder, as if turned to stone, the mocking
smile frozen on her lips, a look of terror and defiance on
her face. Mrs. Artress, retaining more of self-possession
than the others, stared at Neva with unmistakable
hatred and triumph. The treacherous French woman
drooped her gaze, and grew pale and awe-stricken.</p>

<p>Neva, still clutching the letter to her bosom, looked at
her enemies one by one, her red-brown eyes blazing. It
seemed to those who looked upon her that the red
flames leaped from her eyes of gloom, and they trembled
before her. Her pure, proud face was deathly
white, but it was stern and awful in its wondrous beauty,
as she turned it from one to another in an expression of
scathing contempt that stung Craven and Octavia Black
to the very soul.</p>

<p>Then, without a word, but with her letter still
clutched against her panting breast, the young girl
swept from the room with the air, the step, and the
haughty carriage of an insulted empress.</p>

<p>The conspirators heard her slowly ascend the stairs to
her own room. They stared at each other for a brief
space in an utter and terrible silence. Mrs. Craven<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
Black was the first to speak, and her companions
started as her voice broke the dead and awful hush.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” she ejaculated, forcing a
strange, hoarse, and uneasy laugh, that jarred on the
ears of her fellow conspirators.</p>

<p>“A queen of tragedy!” muttered Mrs. Artress, referring
to Neva’s appearance and departure from
their presence.</p>

<p>Craven Black sighed and scowled darkly. An ugly
smile disfigured his mouth.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “matters have been brought to a crisis.
I would have preferred to keep up the semblance of
friendship a while longer, but the girl has torn the masks
from our faces. She has declared war—so war let it be.
In the fight before us, the strongest must conquer!”</p>

<p>“I could not dream she would follow me,” said the
French woman deprecatingly. “I am not to blame. I
am sure, very sure, that she is going to run away. She
will leave the Wilderness to-night.”</p>

<p>The ugly smile deepened upon Craven Black’s visage.</p>

<p>“We will see!” he said, and his voice was terrible in
its significance and threatening.</p>

<p>The French woman had read Neva’s purpose aright.</p>

<p>The young lady went up to her room and closed her
door, and held in the flames of the bright wood fire the
torn and crumpled letter she had written to her lover,
and which she had rescued from the hands of Craven
Black. She let the small burning remnant of paper fall
upon the blazing log, and watched the blue shrivelled ash
wave to and fro in the current of air, and then whirl
upward into the capacious chimney.</p>

<p>The letter thus destroyed, Neva, with a white face and
wild eyes, set about her few preparations for departure.
Her soul was in a tumult; her brain seemed on fire.
She could not think or reason yet; she only knew that she<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
longed to get away, that she <em>must</em> get away. She put on
her round hat above her braids, and was about to throw
about her a light shawl, when a sudden fierce rattling of
the casements in the wind warned her that a night in
late September in the Scottish Highlands was likely to
be cold. She opened one of her trunks and dragged out
to the light a pretty sleeved jacket of the soft and delicate
fur of the silver fox, and this she put on. She took
up her muff and dressing bag and hurried into the ante-room,
panting and breathless, eager for the outer air.</p>

<p>The door opening from the ante-room into the hall
was closed. Neva pulled it open—and found herself
face to face with Mr. and Mrs. Craven Black, Mrs. Artress
and the French woman!</p>

<p>The girl recoiled an instant before this human barricade
as if she had received a blow. Then she waved her
hand in a haughty, commanding gesture, and said:</p>

<p>“Let me pass! Stand aside!”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, Miss Wynde,” said Craven Black mockingly.
“This lady, my wife, is your personal guardian,
and she has the authority to control your movements—”</p>

<p>The girl’s passionate eyes flashed stormily at her enemies.</p>

<p>“Let me pass I say!” she cried, in a low, suppressed
voice. “Attempt to detain me here, and I will arouse
the household!”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said Craven Black, tauntingly. “The two
stolid women in the kitchen cannot hear you; and if
they could, they have been prepared for your outcries,
and will not heed them. The sailors are on the yacht,
in the loch below. You are out of the world up in this
eagle’s eyrie, and you may beat your wings against the
bars of your cage till you drop dead, my pretty bird, but
no one will heed your flutterings. Call, if you will. Try
the effect of a shriek!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>He took a step nearer to Neva, who retreated before
him, shrinking from his touch. He went after her into
the room, his companions following. Celeste closed the
door, and placed herself against it.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Neva,” said Octavia Black, with a mocking
intonation. “Lay aside your hat and sacque. Don’t
abandon us upon the very evening of our arrival in our
new residence.”</p>

<p>Neva made no answer, but Octavia shrank before the
stern accusing of the girl’s gloomy, passionate eyes.</p>

<p>“As your guardian,” said Mrs. Black, recovering her
self-possession, which had been momentarily shaken, “I
desire to ask you where you were about to go when we
intercepted you?”</p>

<p>“I might refuse to answer, madam,” replied Neva,
“but you know as well as I do that I was about to start
for Inverness on foot, and that I intended to go back to
Hawkhurst and to my friends. Unfortunately, Mrs. Black,
you are my personal guardian; but Sir John Freise and
my other guardians, are desirous that I should choose
another in your stead, and I shall now do so. Your
character, madam, is at last revealed to me in all its
moral hideousness. My recent vague suspicions of you
have become certainties. Mr. Atkins was right in his
distrust of you. But, madam, because my dead father
loved and trusted you to the last hour of his life, because
you have borne his honored name, I will spare you
from blame and obloquy, and screen your ill-doings and
ill-treatment of me even from my guardians. I will
agree to thus screen you if you will stand aside and let
me go forth now, at this moment.”</p>

<p>“But, Neva,” said Mrs. Black, “you will lose your way
on the mountains; you will make a misstep over some
cliff, or into some ravine; or you will die of cold and
exhaustion long before you can reach Inverness. It is<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
twenty miles as the crow flies. It is forty, as you would
have to travel. We will not send you in the yacht.
Your scheme of departure is impracticable. In fact, you
cannot go.”</p>

<p>“You mean to detain me here a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Call yourself by what name you will,” said Craven
Black, “you cannot go.”</p>

<p>The young girl looked around her desperately, like a
hunted deer. There was no pity or sympathy in those
hard and greedy faces. Had she been penniless, she
would have been as free as the birds of the air; but being
rich, her enemies looked upon her as their rightful
prey.</p>

<p>“Are you a pack of outlaws?” demanded Neva, her
young voice ringing through the room. “How dare you
thus interfere with the liberty of an English woman?”</p>

<p>“You are not an English woman, but only an English
girl,” interrupted Octavia Black. “You are a minor,
without right or liberty or the exercise of your own will.
You are my ward, Neva, and as your guardian I command
your obedience. How can you reconcile it with
your conscience to rebel against your step-mother?”</p>

<p>“You are not my step-mother,” cried Neva hotly.
“When you ceased to be my father’s widow, you ceased
to be my step-mother.”</p>

<p>“I think the law takes another view of such a case,”
said Mrs. Black. “But, at any rate, I am still your guardian,
and as such I have a right to read all the letters
you write or receive. I read your letter to Lord Towyn,
and exhibited it to my husband—”</p>

<p>“And to your husband’s cousin, and to your maid,”
said Neva. “I am aware of all that. As to your right
to examine my letters, I do not believe in it. Your
action in opening my letter to Lord Towyn,” and Neva’s
cheeks flamed, “and in reading its contents aloud to your<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
familiars, was an act of the grossest indelicacy and want
of honor and moral principle. Any person with a grain
of decency in his composition will confirm what I say!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Craven Black was stung to fury by this outspoken
declaration, its truthfulness giving it keener
effect. She compressed her lips, being unable to speak,
and hurried to and fro with uneven tread like a caged
tigress.</p>

<p>“We will not discuss the right or wrong of Mrs.
Black’s very natural and proper act,” said Craven Black.
“She had the right to read your letter, and therefore did
read it. I think you have no further fault to find with
us than this?”</p>

<p>“Such an indelicate letter for a young lady to write,”
murmured Mrs. Artress, turning her eyes upward. “‘My
own dear Arthur.’ I never was so shocked!”</p>

<p>Neva turned her back upon the woman, without a
word, and replied to Craven Black as if she had not
heard his cousin speak.</p>

<p>“I have other fault to find with you, Mr. Black,” the
young girl said haughtily. “You and your wife have
been false and treacherous to me from the beginning.
You planned to come to this place before you left Hawkhurst,
and you sent Mrs. Artress on in advance to prepare
this house for your reception. Yet you pretended
to me that we were to go by rail into Yorkshire. You
allowed me to convey that impression to my friends,
while you intended the impression to be a false one.
The manner in which you proceeded from the railway
station to Gravesend, and in which you have come to
this place, has been secret and furtive, as if you meant
to throw off pursuit. You have shamefully deceived me,
and I regard your conduct and that of your wife, now
that my eyes have been opened, as base, mean, and
treacherous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>“Regard it as you like,” said Craven Black airily,
although his face flushed. “My dear child, you are
beating against your bars like the bird in the cage to
which I likened you. Don’t waste your strength in this
manner. Be reasonable, and submit to the power of
those who have right and strength upon their side.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black paused in her walk before Neva, and said
vindictively, and even fiercely:</p>

<p>“That is what you will have to do, Neva—submit!
We are stronger than you, I should think your conscience
would reproach you for rebelling against me in
this manner. Did not your father a score of times enjoin
you in his letters to love and obey me? Did he not in
his will enjoin you to cling to me, and be gentle and
loving and obedient to my wishes? Is it thus you
respect his wishes and memory—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Neva imperiously. “How dare you
urge my father’s wishes upon me? How dare you speak
of respect to his memory, which you outraged at the
time of your recent and third marriage, when you summoned
my father’s tenantry to a ball, and made merry
in my father’s house, thus virtually rejoicing in his
death? I cannot hear my father’s name from your lips,
madam.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t!” sneered Octavia Black. “You will
have to hear whatever I may choose to say of him; let
me tell you that, Miss Neva. You may fling off my
authority and your late father’s together, if you choose,
but his last letter to you should be held sacred by you,
and its injunctions fulfilled to the letter, as sacred commands
from the dead to the living.”</p>

<p>“That last letter!” said Neva. “The letter written
by Craven Black, with your assistance and connivance!
Ah, you start. You see that I comprehend you at last—that
I have fathomed your wickedness! That letter,<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
now in the hands of Lord Towyn or Mr. Atkins, or Sir
John Freise, emanated from Craven Black’s brain and
hand. It was a clever forgery, but, thank God, I know
it to be a forgery! My father could never have so coolly
and easily disposed of his daughter’s future. He never
wrote that letter!”</p>

<p>The girl spoke in a tone of such firm conviction, as if
she knew whereof she affirmed, that the discomfited
plotters made no attempt to deny her assertion. The
Blacks looked at each other darkly, and read in each
other’s eyes incitement to continue in their wickedness
with unabated courage. Mrs. Artress looked on, evilly
exultant. She had never liked the heiress of Hawkhurst,
with her dainty beauty, her piquant witchery of face and
manner, and with all the wealth that seemed so boundless.
Mrs. Artress was jealous, envious, and full of
hatred of her, and her greed of money had been enlisted
against the young girl.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, during which Neva sat down
laying aside her muff and dressing bag. Presently she
said:</p>

<p>“I understand you now, as you know. I trust that you
understand me. I will not trouble you to deal more in
subterfuges and deceptions. I comprehend that I have
been decoyed here for a purpose, and that I am now your
prisoner. What is your purpose against me?”</p>

<p>“We have no purpose against you, Neva,” said Octavia
Black quite calmly, and even pleasantly. “You deceive
yourself. We saw you anxious to plunge into
marriage with Lord Towyn, but disapproving the match,
I have brought you here. I stand in the relation of a
parent to you, and use a parent’s authority, as I have a
right. I have other designs for you. A worthy and accomplished
young man, the son of my present husband,
has solicited your hand in marriage, and I am anxious<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
that you should enter the same family with myself. We
will not coerce you; but I am sure, after a residence
more or less prolonged at this Wilderness, you will be
glad to marry Rufus Black and go back into society.
You shall have sufficient time for consideration. I am
ready to sacrifice myself and remain here all winter, if
necessary to bring you to the desired view of the subject.”</p>

<p>“One thing we may as well make plain,” said Craven
Black deliberately. “When you leave this house, Miss
Wynde, it will be as the promised bride of my son.”</p>

<p>Neva’s eyes flashed mutiny.</p>

<p>“Is Rufus Black a party to this scheme?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Black promptly. “He knows nothing
of my designs. I have told him to hope that you will
relent, and he thinks that his step-mother has unbounded
influence over you, which she will use in his behalf.
Rufus is a poor, weak young fellow, with all his desirable
qualities, and he would sooner cut his throat than
force you into a marriage with him. No; Rufus is at
Hawkhurst, where I have ordered him to remain until
our return, or until he hears from me. He supposes us
to be in Yorkshire. We are ready to start for your home
with you any day when you shall have given us your
oath that this visit to the Highlands shall be kept secret
by you, and that you will marry Rufus on your return to
Hawkhurst. These are our terms.”</p>

<p>“I have said upon what terms I am willing to keep
your villainy secret,” said Neva haughtily. “My condition
is that I am immediately allowed to go free. I shall not
repeat that offer after to-night. I shall never agree to your
terms. I shall never marry Rufus Black. I am betrothed
to a noble and honorable gentleman, and I regard my
promise to him as sacred as any oath. In short, Mr. and<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
Mrs. Craven Black, I will stay here until I die before I will
yield to your dominion, or perjure myself by a cowardly
oath.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Black. “It only remains to see which
will hold out the longest, besiegers or besieged. Octavia,
let us go. A night of reflection may bring our young
lady to terms.”</p>

<p>“I have a last word to say,” exclaimed Neva, arising,
her young face full of a bitter and passionate rebellion
against her enemies. “You have not fairly counted the
cost of your present undertaking, Mr. and Mrs. Black.
The heiress of Hawkhurst, the only child of the late Sir
Harold Wynde, the betrothed wife of the wealthiest
young nobleman in Great Britain, cannot disappear in a
manner so mysterious without exciting attention. I shall
be sought after far and wide. My three guardians will set
the officers of the law upon my track. Even now it is
quite possible my friends may be on their way to this place.
I shall be rescued from your hands, and you will be rewarded
with the punishment and ignominy you deserve.”</p>

<p>“You believe all this?” cried Craven Black. “You
think I am clumsy enough to permit myself to be
tracked? How little you know me! I defy all the detectives
in the world to trace me. I did not buy the
yacht. A friend bought it in his own name, and provisioned
it. The three sailors on board the yacht will
never see a newspaper; will not stir out of the loch, and
will see no one. I have attached them to me by a free
use of money, and I have a hold upon them in knowing
their past. If the officers of the law were to trace you
to the loch below us, the men would not dare to reveal
your whereabouts, for fear of being held as conspirators
against your liberty. The two women-servants in this
house never stir off the plateau. The cabman I hired to
convey us from the London railway station to Gravesend,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
I discovered, in my conversation with him, was employed
for that day alone, to take the place of the cabman
who was ill. The fellow told me he was a navvy,
bound for a voyage the next day, and he wished he
could sail our yacht instead of going out to Australia
in a steamer. You see how my tracks are covered?
Your help must come from yourself, not from Lord
Towyn. I have no more to say at present. If you
choose to come to terms, you can send Celeste to my
wife at any moment. Permit me to wish you a good-night.”</p>

<p>He approached her as if to shake hands. Neva
gathered up her effects and retreated into her room.
The next instant a key was inserted in the lock, and the
bolt was shot home. Neva was in truth a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Celeste, you will occupy this room,” said Mrs. Black,
to her maid, “and you must sleep with one eye open.
Miss Wynde is desperate, and may attempt to pick the
lock, or to escape by one of her windows.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of pursuit,” said Mr. Black meditatively,
“but I would like to throw the pursuers upon a
wrong scent. I wish I could get Lord Towyn over upon
the Continent, with that sharp-eyed Atkins. How
can we contrive to give them the impression that we are
gone upon a Continental tour?”</p>

<p>They pondered the question for many minutes.</p>

<p>“I have it,” said Celeste at last. “I have a sister
who lives in Brussels, and who works in a milliner’s
shop in the Rue Montague de la Cour. You shall write
a letter for Mademoiselle, Mr. Black, in her very handwriting,
and date the letter Brussels, and I will send it
under cover to my sister to be posted at Brussels. Yes,
my faith, we have it. One of the sailors shall post my
letter, with its inclosure, from Inverness. It is well, is
it not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>The plan suited Mr. and Mrs. Black, who resolved to
act upon it. The whole party adjourned to the drawing-room.
Mrs. Craven Black brought forth several
letters she had formerly received from Neva while at
the Paris school, and which she had preserved for possible
use. Mr. Black still retained the envelope to the
letter Neva had addressed to her lover, and which he
had intercepted. With these materials, and his skill
at counterfeiting, Craven Black set to work to write a
letter in Neva’s name, and dated at Brussels. While he
was thus engaged, Mrs. Black supplying him with suitable
paper and ink, the French maid wrote to her sister
at Brussels, requesting her to stamp and forward the
inclosed missive. Octavia Black gave her attendant
a Bank of England note to inclose in payment of the
service.</p>

<p>The double letter was finished and sealed that night,
and Craven Black went to Inverness the next day in the
yacht and posted it.</p>

<p>This then was the letter which had been brought up
to London to Lord Towyn by his steward, and which
the young earl, having read, and so instantly and vehemently
pronounced a forgery.</p>

<p>But though it failed of its object, and did not deceive
the keen-witted young lover as to its origin, it did not
enlighten him as to Neva’s whereabouts. He continued
his search for her, calling in the aid of professional detectives,
Mr. Atkins devoting his time also to the search,
but they failed to find a clue to the missing young girl.
And she, hidden in the far-off Scottish wilds, among
mountain peaks and in a secluded rocky wilderness,
looked in vain for her lover’s coming. Her enemies
were indeed more cunning than she had dreamed, and
it seemed indeed as if the words of Craven Black would
prove true, and the matter between the “besiegers and<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
the besieged” would become a question of resistance.
Which would be the first to yield to the loneliness and
gloom of the Wilderness, and to the rigors of the swiftly
approaching Highland winter?</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MRS. BLIGHT ENTERS UPON HER MOURNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sudden death of Mrs. Wroat proved a severe shock
to poor Lally Bird, who had grown to love the eccentric,
but kind-hearted old lady with a daughter’s affection.
She hurriedly dressed herself, and came down to Mrs.
Wroat’s chamber, pale and awe-struck, with a horrible
sense of desolation and misery. It seemed as if a fatality
attended her—that those whom she loved were in
some way doomed. Her parents were dead, her young
husband had been taken from her, and now her great-aunt
had died, and she was again alone. She was not
selfish in her grief, but she could not help thinking of
her own bitter loneliness, as she bent over the still
figure, and softly and reverently touched the straying
locks of gray hair, and pressed her lips to the shrivelled
mouth from which the angel smile seemed slowly fading.</p>

<p>Peters had by this time regained her self-command.
There was much to do, and it devolved upon her to do
it. Her tears must wait for a more convenient season.
She was anxious that “all things should be done decently
and in order,” and that due respect should be given the
dead mistress she had so loved. Her first act then, after
arousing Lally and the servants, was to dispatch the<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
footman to the family physician, and to Mr. Harris, Mrs.
Wroat’s lawyer.</p>

<p>The physician came first. He showed no surprise at
the summons, and acknowledged to Peters that he had
expected it before. He could only confirm the discovery
of Peters that the old lady was dead.</p>

<p>The lawyer arrived while the doctor was in the house.
Mrs. Wroat had requested that Mr. Harris should assume
control of her affairs after her death, and he proceeded
to seal her desk and to take charge of her private papers,
while he gave directions for the management of the
household while the dead should remain in the house.
An undertaker was sent for, and all the grim preparations
for the sepulture, so terrible to surviving friends,
was entered upon.</p>

<p>The next morning’s papers contained the obituary
notice of Mrs. Maria Wroat, relict of the late John Wroat,
banker, with a statement of her age and of the time appointed
for the funeral.</p>

<p>The next afternoon brought to the door of the mansion
in Mount street a cab, from which alighted Mr. and Mrs.
Blight of Sandy Lands. They sounded the knocker
pompously, ringing the bell at the same moment. The
footman hastened to give them admittance.</p>

<p>“I see by the morning’s papers that my dear aunt is
dead, Toppen,” said the Canterbury lawyer, who was
known and detested by Mrs. Wroat’s servants. “Why
was I not informed of her dangerous illness?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wroat died sudden, sir,” answered the man
respectfully.</p>

<p>“Why was I not telegraphed to immediately upon
her death?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. Mr. Harris, he manages the
funeral, sir.”</p>

<p>“Show us up to our room, Toppen. You are perhaps<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
aware that I am the old lady’s heir? I am the nephew
of her deceased husband, who left her a good share of
his property. It all comes to me. I shall continue you
in my service, Toppen, when I come up to town to live,
which will be immediately. But, come. Show us our
room.”</p>

<p>Toppen hesitated.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, “but I’ll just speak to
Mrs. Peters. Miss Wroat she can’t be disturbed, and I
don’t know which room azackly Mrs. Peters intends for
you.”</p>

<p>“The amber room, of course,” said Mrs. Blight superciliously.
“We shall have the best room in the house,
whatever Mrs. Peters or any one else may say.”</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat has the amber room,” said Toppen.</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat!” repeated the lawyer. “And who may
Miss Wroat be?”</p>

<p>“She is Mrs. Wroat’s young niece, sir, that she fetched
home with her from Canterbury. The Missus said we
were to call the young lady Miss Wroat. If you’ll walk
into the drawing-room, I’ll go for Mrs. Peters.”</p>

<p>The Blights went into the drawing-room as desired,
and there awaited Mrs. Peters’ appearance with outward
bravado and some inward anxiety.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose the old woman can have made a
will giving Lally Bird her fortune?” whispered the Canterbury
lawyer’s wife.</p>

<p>“No. I think she went off so suddenly at the last
that she had no time to make a will. But if she did
make one I stand as good a chance as any one of inheriting
her money, even after all that has come and gone
between her and us. She got her money from her husband,
who was my uncle. The old woman had a stern
sense of justice, and she would never have left her entire
fortune away from her husband’s nephew, who had, as<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
one may say, a claim upon it. No doubt she left her
great-niece a legacy, but you’ll find that we come in for
the best share of her money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blight did not reflect that Mrs. Wroat’s “stern
sense of justice” might cause her to leave her money
away from him, instead of leaving it to him.</p>

<p>“No matter whether she leaves the girl fifty pounds a
year or two hundred pounds a year,” said Mrs. Blight
venomously, “she goes out of this house on the day
after the funeral, bag and baggage, the artful jade! I
won’t have her under my roof a night longer than I can
help.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Laura. We should have had the whole
pile only for her.”</p>

<p>“I shall furnish the whole house new,” said Mrs.
Blight reflectively. “Aunt Wroat had abominable taste,
and the colors here quite ruin my complexion. Why
don’t Peters or the housekeeper come? I shall discharge
Peters—”</p>

<p>The last words were overheard by Peters herself, who
came in in list slippers and a black gown, staid, angular,
and sour-visaged as usual, with a warm heart nearly
bursting with grief under her prim bodice. She courtesied
to the self-invited guests, her lips tightly compressed,
and an ominous gleam in her tear-blurred eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, Peters at last!” said Mrs. Blight condescendingly.
“We want to go up to our room, Peters, before
we see the remains of our dear aunt. Why were we not
sent for yesterday, Peters?”</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Harris forgot to telegraph to you,”
said Peters grimly. “He spoke of doing so. Your room
is ready, and I’ll send Buttons up to show you the way.”</p>

<p>“Toppen calls Miss Bird Miss Wroat—ha, ha!”
laughed the Canterbury lawyer. “A queer idea, isn’t it,
Peters? Does the girl call herself Miss Wroat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>Peters bowed.</p>

<p>“It was my lady’s wish,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said Mr. Blight. “By the by, Peters, here’s
a sovereign for you. I always admired your sturdy independence,
Peters. My aunt loved you, ah, like a sister,
and leaned upon you, and all that, Peters. I hope
she has remembered you at the last. It would be a pity
if she had not left some trifle, to mark her appreciation
of your fidelity and affection.”</p>

<p>“I have no fault to find,” said Peters coldly, rejecting
the coin. “My dear lady remembered me generously in
her will—”</p>

<p>“Her will?” interrupted Mr. Blight eagerly. “She
did make a will then? I am glad to hear it. Had she
died without a will, Miss Bird and Mrs. Wroat’s other
relatives would have divided the Wroat property and
fattened upon it. As it is, I am sure Mrs. Wroat has
done me justice. She would not have remembered any
faults of ours in her dying hour, but would have seen to
it that Mr. Wroat’s nephew had his proper share in Mr.
Wroat’s property. I suppose you know the purport of
the will.”</p>

<p>Peters bowed assent.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind a matter of five pounds,” said Mr.
Blight insinuatingly. “I should like to know if my poor
aunt did justice to me in her last moments?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your money, Mr. Blight,” said Peters,
“but if you are anxious to know, I will tell you that
Mrs. Wroat did you justice in her will. That is all that
I will say. I am not at liberty to betray the contents of
the will, which will be read immediately after the
burial.”</p>

<p>The countenances of the two fortune-hunters glowed
with delight. They interpreted Mrs. Peters’ words to
suit themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Peters gave them no time for further questioning.
She summoned the boot-boy, and ordered him to conduct
the guests to their chamber, and then departed to
the room where her dead mistress was lying. The boy
led the way up stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Blight following, and
ushered them into the red room, opposite Lally’s apartment,
and next in beauty and convenience to Lally’s
rooms.</p>

<p>“Peters goes out of this house when Miss Bird goes,”
cried Mrs. Blight, sinking into a chair and puffing heavily.
“Charles, I believe I shall take the old lady’s room
for mine, and save coming up stairs. It will be so convenient.
And you must run out a new dressing-room
and bath-room; those down stairs don’t suit me at all.
Aunt Wroat’s personal tastes were so horrid plain. I
shall clean out all the present servants. I know that
Toppen hates us both, but he was forced to be civil to
the heir, you know. And, by the way, we must have
mourning clothes, Charles. You must write to your
tailor to send a man to take your measure immediately,
and I will drop a note to Jay’s, and have them send a
complete mourning outfit and a dressmaker to me.”</p>

<p>The notes were written in Mr. Blight’s most grandiloquent
style, and although they were brief, they betrayed
the complacency of a satisfied heir in every line.</p>

<p>The tailor and dressmaker arrived in due time, and
Mrs. Blight discussed ribbons and shades of silk, and
the respective merits of French and English crape up
stairs, while the old lady was being robed for the grave
below, and Lally lay upon her own bed, weeping as
though her heart were breaking.</p>

<p>Lally kept to her own room until after the funeral.
She could not eat nor sleep. Etiquette forbade her
attending her deceased relative to the grave, but she<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
watched the departure of the funeral train from her window,
her eyes almost blinded with her tears.</p>

<p>After the funeral, Mr. Blight and Mr. Harris the lawyer
returned to the mansion in Mount street, and the latter
summoned Mrs. Blight, Lally and Peters, to hear the
will read.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blight swept in, clad in the deepest mourning,
her garments covered deep with crape, a black-bordered
handkerchief held at her eyes. Mr. Blight placed an
armed chair for her near the hearth, the October day
being chilly, and took a seat at her side with quite an
air of proprietorship of the house.</p>

<p>Lally, in deep mourning, came next, with the faithful
Peters, also in mourning habiliments. Mr. Harris placed
a chair for Lally, and Peters sat near her young mistress,
to whose service she intended to devote herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris then, with preparatory clearings of his
throat, read the will. It commenced by declaring the
testator of sound mind, being the usual formula, and
proceeded with an enumeration of property at which the
Blights grew inwardly radiant.</p>

<p>“All this, my real and personal property,” read Mr.
Harris, in effect, “I give and bequeath, absolutely and
without reserve, to—my beloved great-niece, Lally Bird,
the daughter of John Bird and Clara Mulford Percy his
wife, to her and to her heirs and assigns forever.”</p>

<p>The Blights gasped for breath.</p>

<p>Lally’s countenance did not change. She knew that
her days of poverty were over; that she would never
again wander shelterless and forlorn, glad to find shelter
at night in a barn, and famished for food. All that distress
for her was forever past. Her comfort and prosperity
had been secured by the tenderness of her kindly
and eccentric old relative, but Lally would willingly
have gone back to her old-time poverty and toil, if by<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
so doing she might have recalled her good friend from
her grave.</p>

<p>“I say, this is simply infamous!” gasped Mr. Blight,
turning upon Mr. Harris fiercely. “Infamous, sir! Do
you know whose money, sir, this wretched old dotard
has willed away so lightly? I’ll tell you, sir. It was my
late uncle’s. It should be mine—and, by Heaven, it shall
be mine. I’ll appeal to the law. I’ll contest the will!”</p>

<p>“Are you a lawyer? Why do you talk so childishly?”
demanded Mr. Harris. “The property of which Mrs.
Wroat has disposed was hers absolutely, to dispose of as
she pleased. If your late uncle had wished to provide
for you, he would have done so. You are no relative of
Mrs. Wroat, and you ought to know that if you contest
the will, you won’t get a penny. The girl would get it
just the same—at least a portion of it—even if you succeeded
in breaking the will, which you can’t. Mrs.
Wroat was indisputably in sound mind when she dictated
that will. Under any circumstances, Mr. Blight,
you can get nothing. With the exception of an annuity
to be paid out of the income to Peters during her lifetime,
the remainder of the property is absolutely Miss
Bird’s—or Miss Wroat’s, as it was the wish of our deceased
friend that the young lady should be called.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blight sullenly recognized the truth of these
words. He had been left out in the cold, and he was
angry, disappointed, infuriated.</p>

<p>“Oh, my new and expensive mourning!” said Mrs.
Blight spitefully. “I wouldn’t have put on black for the
old creature if I had known the truth. Peters ought to
pay me the hundred pounds I have expended. I shall
sell every black rag I’ve bought!”</p>

<p>Lally arose to retire, and Mr. Harris and Peters
attended her from the room. Mr. Harris presently returned,
and said gravely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Wroat is fatigued, and Mrs. Peters thinks her
unequal to the task of entertaining guests. At the request
of Mrs. Peters, therefore, I have to suggest, sir and
madam that you take your leave without again seeing
Miss Wroat. I will remain to do the honors of the
house, in Miss Wroat’s stead, at your departure.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Blight, thus quietly dismissed, retired to
their room and packed their effects. An hour later their
cab was announced, and they came down stairs, the lady
leaning on her husband’s arm and weeping with rage.</p>

<p>As they sat in the cab, the luggage piled on top, and
slowly departed from the house where they had hoped
to reign, Mrs. Blight looked back, sobbing in her
anguish:</p>

<p>“And it might have been ours but for the artful minx
I took in, as it were out of the streets. I’ll never do a
good action again in all my life—never. And now I
must go back to poverty, and scrimp to save what I’ve
spent in mourning, and we and our poor dear lambs may
fetch up at the union, while that treacherous cat Lally
Bird lolls in wealth. O dear! O dear!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FREAK OF DESTINY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Upon the morning after the burial of Mrs. Wroat, and
the utter discomfiture of the fortune-hunting Mr. and
Mrs. Blight, Mr. Harris the lawyer called upon Lally.
His card, with a message written upon it, was brought
up to the young girl in her own room by Toppen, and
Lally came down to the drawing-room, accompanied by<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
Peters. Poor Lally looked very small and weak and
childlike in her deep mourning garb, but when she lifted
her sorrowful black eyes, the lawyer read in them a woman’s
capacity for suffering, a woman’s strong and resolute
character, a woman’s enlightened and awakened
soul.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Wroat,” he said, with paternal
kindness, shaking her hand warmly. “You are looking
ill. Ought you not to seek change of air and scene?”</p>

<p>“I would rather remain here, sir,” said Lally wearily;
“that is, if I may.”</p>

<p>“You can go and come at your own will, my dear
young lady,” said Mr. Harris. “Mrs. Wroat has left you
entire liberty to do as you please. This house is yours,
and a small country property as well. I came this morning
to discuss business with you. I have been the lawyer
and business agent of our lamented friend Mrs.
Wroat for a third of a century or more, and it was her
will that I should continue to have the management of
the Wroat property until your marriage, or the attainment
of your majority. You are absolute mistress of
this house. Is it your desire to keep up the establishment
just as it is, or would you prefer a life of greater
freedom and of less care?”</p>

<p>“I will stay here,” declared Lally. “This house
seems home to me. Aunt Wroat loved it, and I will
keep it just as she left it. Everything that she has loved
or treasured will be sacred to me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harris looked approval of the sentiment. Peters’
sour, sharp-featured countenance actually beamed with
an unwonted warmth and pleasure. She had feared in
her inmost soul that the massive, old-fashioned furniture
with its odd carvings and quaint designs was to be
sent to an auction room, and to be replaced by modern
upholstery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“Shall you retain the present housekeeper and servants?”
inquired the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lally, “the household is to remain exactly
as it is. Mrs. Peters will also remain with me as a
friend and attendant. She is the only friend I have
now.”</p>

<p>“Not the only one, Miss Wroat,” said the lawyer
warmly. “I am your friend, if you will permit me to call
myself so. I have now to explain to you the amount of
your income. When the late Mr. Wroat died, many
years ago, he bequeathed to his wife who has just died
the sum of fifty thousand pounds in securities and real
estate. Mrs. Wroat had few expenses outside her own
household, and did not expend her entire income, the
balance of which has been allowed to accumulate, being
annually added to the principal. Thus Mrs. Wroat died
possessed of over sixty thousand pounds, ten thousand
of which is in real estate. This house is not included in
the estimate I have made, having been settled upon Mrs.
Wroat at her marriage, as her own property to do with
as she pleased. In addition to the real estate, therefore,
you have fifty thousand pounds, which is invested
in the three per cents, in foreign railway shares, in
United States bonds, and in other perfectly safe and reliable
securities. The interest upon these investments
varies from three to seven per cent., but averages five
per cent., and I have to announce to you that you have
therefore an annual income of twenty-five hundred
pounds, of which, by your aunt’s will, you come into immediate
possession. Out of this twenty-five hundred
pounds per annum, one hundred pounds is to be paid
each year to Mrs. Peters, so long as she lives. The rest
is absolutely your own! Have I made the matter perfectly
plain to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said Lally. “It is a large fortune, is it
not?”</p>

<p>“It is a very fine income for a young lady,” assented
Mr. Harris, “very fine indeed. Your expenditures need
not be limited, you see. All reasonable desires can find
perfect gratification upon your income, Miss Wroat.
Should you desire it, you can take a house at Brighton
for the season, or you might find an agreeable change in
visiting your country place, although this is scarcely the
season.”</p>

<p>“I like the country,” said Lally, “and I think it very
pleasant in October.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so it is in Kent and Surrey, and the south of
England,” said Mr. Harris, “but this is not a fancy seat,
Miss Wroat, and it’s away off at the north—in Scotland,
in fact, and on the sea coast. It’s fearfully wild in winter,
I’m told, up there. The snow falls early, and the winds
rage, and the thermometer falls below zero.”</p>

<p>“I was never in Scotland,” said Lally, a little flush of
interest brightening her wan small face. “And I own a
place up there—a farm perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Two or three farms, but the soil is sterile, and there
is an old house in fine order.”</p>

<p>“Where is this place? Near Edinburgh?”</p>

<p>“Far north of Edinburgh, Miss Wroat. It’s near Inverness—away
out of the world at this season, you see.
I was up there last year with a shooting party, Mrs.
Wroat kindly placing the house at my disposal. There’s
capital shooting over the estate, and we had a good time,
the house being furnished, and a steward residing in a
cottage on the estate.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go up there,” said Lally. “Perhaps
I will a little later—but not yet. I don’t mind the lateness
of the season, Mr. Harris, and I am not afraid of
cold and wind and snow, if I can have shelter and fires.<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
In fact, I think I would like to hide myself in some far
off hidden nook until I shall have learned to bear my
trials with fortitude. Life is so very bitter to me, Mr.
Harris.”</p>

<p>“Life bitter at seventeen!” said the lawyer, with an
indulgent smile. “You have money, youth, beauty, and
will have hosts of friends. You will learn, as we all do,
sooner or later, Miss Wroat, to take the bitter with the
sweet, and to thank God for all his goodness, instead of
repining because one or two blessings are withheld out
of so many given. But I will not bore you with a sermon.
I have little more to say this morning except that,
should you need me, I entreat that you will call upon me
at any time. I will come to you at a moment’s notice.
Is there anything I can now do for you?”</p>

<p>There was nothing, but Lally expressed her gratitude
for the offer. Mrs. Peters had a few questions to ask,
and when these had been duly answered, Mr. Harris
paid into Lally’s hands the sum of six hundred pounds
being one quarter’s income. He then departed.</p>

<p>The young girl spent the remainder of the day in her
own room, not even coming forth to her meals. The
next day she came down to the dining-room, but immediately
after dinner retired to her apartment. She read
no books nor newspapers, but sat before her fire hour
after hour, silently brooding, and Peters with an unspeakable
anxiety beheld the round gipsy face grow thin and
pallid, dark circles form under the black eyes, and the
light figure grow lighter and more slender, until she
feared that the young mistress would soon follow the
old one.</p>

<p>In her distress, Peters had an interview with the housekeeper,
and expressed her fears and anxieties.</p>

<p>“A good wind would just blow Miss Lally away,” she<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
said. “She’s pining, and the first we know she’ll be
dead. What can I do?”</p>

<p>“Who’d have thought she’d have loved the Missus so
much?” said the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that alone,” declared Peters, “although she
loved Mrs. Wroat as a daughter might have loved her,
but she’s had other troubles that I’m not at liberty to
speak of, but which are pressing on her, along with her
great-aunt’s death, until, I think, the double burden will
crush her into the grave. She don’t eat more than a
bird. I ordered her mourning for her, and when the
shopman brought great parcels of silks and bombazines
and crapes, she never even looked at them, but said,
‘Peters, please select for me. You know what I want.’
The dressmaker was in despair yesterday, because my
young lady would not take an interest in her clothes,
and did not give a single direction beyond having them
made very plainly. I’ll go and see Mr. Harris about
her, or else the doctor.”</p>

<p>“What does a man know in a case like this?” exclaimed
the housekeeper. “The young lady is pining
herself to death, Mrs. Peters, and that’s the long and
the short of it. This great house is dull and lonely to
her, and the gloom of the funeral isn’t out of it yet.
The young mistress wants change—that’s what she
wants. Take her to some watering-place, or to the Continent,
or somewhere else, and give her new interests
and a change of scene, and she’ll come back as pert and
chipper as any bird.”</p>

<p>The idea struck Mrs. Peters favorably. She hastened
up stairs to the amber room, and softly entered. Lally
sat in a great chair before the hearth, her little shrunken
figure quite lost among the cushions, her small wan face
startlingly pale, and her great black eyes fixed upon the<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
fire. She looked up at her attendant, who approached
her with a swelling heart, but with outward calmness.</p>

<p>“If you please, Miss Lally,” said Peters, broaching
her wishes without delay, “I’ve been thinking that the
house is so gloomy without the dear old mistress, and
that you keep so close to your room that you will be ill
directly unless some change is made. And I am sure I’d
like a change too, for a week or month. And so I make
bold to ask you to go for a month to Brighton.”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head with a look of pain.</p>

<p>“Not there,” she murmured. “I cannot bear the
crowds, the gayety, the careless faces and curious eyes.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go up to the Heather Hills, your Scottish
place,” urged Peters. “I have been there once, and
we could take Toppen with us, Miss Lally. The steward
who lives on the estate can provide us with servants.
Let me telegraph him to-day, and let us start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the young mistress listlessly. “If
you wish it, Peters, we will go.”</p>

<p>The sour face of the faithful maid brightened, and she
expressed her thanks warmly for the concession.</p>

<p>“I’ll telegraph at once, Miss Lally,” she said. “But
then the steward is not likely to receive the telegram
unless he happens to be at Inverness, which is not likely.
I will send Toppen by the first train to prepare for our
coming, if you are willing, Miss Lally.”</p>

<p>Lally was willing, and Mrs. Peters withdrew to acquaint
the tall footman with her mistress’ design, and to
dispatch him on his journey to the northward. When
he had gone she returned to Lally.</p>

<p>“Toppen is on his way to the station, Miss,” she announced.
“He will have everything in order for us
against our arrival. It is cold at Heather Hills, Miss
Lally, with the wind blowing off the sea, and you will
need flannel and thick boots, and warm clothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>“Order them for me then, Peters,” said Lally, with
listless voice and manner.</p>

<p>“But you will want an astrachan jacket to wear with
your black dresses, and you must try it on, to be sure
that it fits,” said Peters. “And you will want books at
Heather Hills, and these you can choose best for yourself.
And the newspapers must be ordered to be sent to
our new address, but that I can do this evening by letter.
And you will want work materials, Miss Lally, such as
canvas, Berlin wools and patterns; drawing materials,
new music, and other things, perhaps. Let me order the
carriage, and let us go out and make our purchases.”</p>

<p>Lally looked out of the window. The sun was shining,
and the air was clear. She had not been out of the
house for days, and she assented to Mrs. Peters’ proposition.
The maid ordered the carriage, and proceeded to
array her young mistress for her drive.</p>

<p>The carriage, which was called Mrs. Wroat’s carriage,
was a job vehicle, hired by the month at a neighboring
mews, with horses, and with coachman and footman in
livery. It looked like a private brougham, and with its
mulberry-colored linings, and plain but elegantly gotten-up
harness, was very stylish, and even imposing.</p>

<p>When the carriage came around, Lally and her attendant
were quite ready. They descended to the vehicle,
and drove away upon their shopping excursion. A fur
dealer’s was first visited, then a stationer’s and bookseller’s,
then a shop for ladies’ work and their materials.
Lally’s purchases were deposited in the carriage. And
lastly the young girl stopped at a picture dealer’s in Regent
street, a small cabinet painting in the window having
caught her eye.</p>

<p>It was simply a quaint Dutch interior, with a broad
hearth, a boiling pot over the flames, a great tiled chimney-piece,
a Dutch house-wife with ample figure and<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
round, good-natured face, and three or four children
pausing at the threshold of the open door to put off
their shoes before stepping upon the immaculate floor;
a simple picture, executed with fidelity and spirit; but
its charm, in Lally’s eyes, lay in the fact that in the early
days of her marriage, during the brief period she had
passed with Rufus Black in New Brompton, in their
dingy lodgings, he had painted a cabinet picture of a
Dutch interior, nearly like this in design, but as different
in execution as may be imagined. His had been but
a daub, and he had been glad to get fifteen shillings for
it. The price of this picture which had now caught
Lally’s eye was ten guineas.</p>

<p>The young lady had the picture withdrawn from the
window and examined it closely.</p>

<p>“I will take it,” she said. “I will select a suitable
frame, and you may send it home to-day. Here is my
card.”</p>

<p>The picture dealer brought an armful of frames for
her selection, and while she examined the designs and
gilding, a man walked into the shop with a sauntering
gait, and paused near her, in contemplation of an old
cracked painting to which was attached a card declaring
it to be a genuine Murillo.</p>

<p>“This is no more a Murillo than I’m one!” announced
the new-comer loudly, half turning his face toward the
shopman. “A Murillo? It’s a modern daub, gotten up
to sell.”</p>

<p>At the sound of the stranger’s voice Lally started,
dropping the frame she held in her hand. She turned
around quickly, looking at him with dilating eyes and
whitening face, and gasping breath.</p>

<p>The strange connoisseur, who had so boldly given his
opinion of the pretended Murillo, was Rufus Black!</p>

<p>He had tired of the loneliness of Hawkhurst, and had<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
run up to town for a day’s recreation and amusement.
The picture shop in Regent street, into which Lally had
strayed that morning, had long been one of his favorite
haunts, and the picture Lally had just bought had really
given him the idea of the picture he had painted so long
before in the dingy room at New Brompton.</p>

<p>His face was half averted, but Lally knew him, and a
deathly faintness seized upon her. He was well dressed
and possessed an air of elegance that well became him.
His hair was worn long under an artist’s broad-brimmed
hat, and his features from a side view were sharp and
thin. His mouth and chin seemed to have gained firmness
and character during the past few months, but in
the latter feature was still prominent the dimple Lally
had loved, and which, pretty in a woman, is nearly
always a sign of weakness and irresolution in a man.</p>

<p>Rufus turned slowly toward the girlish figure in black,
his gaze seeking the shopman. A low, strange cry broke
from Lally’s lips. Rufus heard it and looked at her.
Her heavy crape vail was thrown back over her bonnet,
and her small face framed in the heavy black folds was
so white, so eager, so piteous, that Rufus thought it a
vision—an optical illusion—a freak of his imagination.
He recoiled in a species of terror.</p>

<p>“Rufus! Oh, Rufus!” cried the deserted young wife
in a wild, involuntary appeal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters heard the name, and comprehended the
identity of the young man. She came and stood by
Lally’s side, warning off Rufus by her harsh face and
angry eyes.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear,” she said, “let us go.”</p>

<p>“Rufus! Oh, Rufus!” moaned the poor young wife
again, seeing nothing but the anguished, horrified face
of her husband, hearing nothing but his quick breathing.</p>

<p>Rufus slowly passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“My God!” he murmured. “Lally’s face! Lally’s
voice!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters took the hand of her young mistress, attempting
to lead her from the shop, which but for them
and the amazed shopman was happily deserted. But Lally
stared at her young husband in a species of fascination,
and he returned her gaze with one of horror and amazement,
and the old woman’s efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear!” whispered Peters anxiously.
“Come with me. Come, my darling! He abandoned
you. Pluck up a spirit, Miss Lally, and leave him
alone!”</p>

<p>Lally slowly arose and moved toward the door, but
coming quite near to her stupefied young husband.</p>

<p>“It is I—Lally,” she said, with the simplicity of a
child, her great black eyes staring at him piteously. “I
am not dead, Rufus. It was not I who was drowned in
the Thames. I know that you are going to be married
again to a great heiress, and I hope you will be happy
with her; but she will never love you as I loved you.
Good-bye, dear—good-bye forever!”</p>

<p>With a great sob Lally flitted past him, and hurried
out to the waiting carriage. Rufus dashed after her,
wild-eyed and wild-visaged; but Mrs. Peters grasped
him vigorously by the arm, detaining him.</p>

<p>“None of that!” she ejaculated harshly. “I won’t
have my young lady tampered with. You shan’t follow
her. You’ve broken her heart already.”</p>

<p>“She’s mine—my wife!” cried Rufus, still amazed,
but in an ecstasy of joy and rapture. “I tell you she’s
mine. I thought she was dead. I am not engaged to
an heiress. I won’t marry one. I want my wife—”</p>

<p>“You’re too late, sir,” said Mrs. Peters grimly. “You
should have made up your mind to that effect at the
time you abandoned her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“But I was compelled to abandon her! God alone
knows the remorse and anguish I have known since I
supposed her dead. I love her better than all the world.
How is it that she lives? Why does she wear mourning?
Woman let me go to her!” And he tried to break from
the detaining grasp of Peters.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the woman still more grimly. “If you
have a spark of manliness, you will let the young lady
alone. She hates you now. I assure you she does. She’s
only a governess, and you’ll lose her her place if you
hang around her. I tell you again she hates you.”</p>

<p>Rufus uttered a low moan, and sat down abruptly
upon a shop bench. Mrs. Peters glided out and entered
the carriage, giving the order to return home.</p>

<p>“I told him a lie, God forgive me!” she muttered, as
she looked at Lally, who lay back upon the cushions,
faint and white. “I told him that you were a governess,
Miss Lally. Let him once get wind of your good
fortune, and he’ll abandon his heiress and come back to
you. Let us start for the north to-night, dear Miss Lally,
and you will not see him if he comes to Mount street.
We can take the night express, and sleep comfortably
with our lap robes, and to-morrow night we will sleep
at Edinburgh.”</p>

<p>“We will do as you say, Peters,” said Lally wearily.
“Only don’t speak to me now.”</p>

<p>She buried her face in the cushions, and was silent
with a stillness like death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rufus Black sat for some minutes in a sort
of stupor, but at last raised his haggard eyes and said
to the shopkeeper:</p>

<p>“The—the lady who passed out, Benson, was my wife.
I had heard she was dead. Can you give me her address?”</p>

<p>The shopman was all sympathy and kindness. He<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
knew Rufus Black had come of a good family, and he
suspected, from the scene he had just witnessed, that
he had experienced trouble through his marriage. He
picked up the mourning card Lally had laid down and
read the address aloud.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Wroat, Mount street, Grosvenor Square,’” repeated
Rufus. “My wife is governess in that family.
Thanks, Benson. I will go to Mount street.”</p>

<p>He went out with staggering steps, hailed a hansom
cab, gave the order, and was driven to the Wroat mansion
in Mount street. The boy called Buttons waited
upon the door in Toppen’s absence. He was a shrewd
lad, and had received private instructions from Peters,
who had just come in with her young mistress.</p>

<p>“I want to see Miss Bird,” said Rufus abruptly, making
a movement to enter the hall.</p>

<p>The boy blocked his path.</p>

<p>“No such lady here, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Black perhaps?” suggested Rufus.</p>

<p>“No such lady,” persisted the boy.</p>

<p>Rufus offered him a bright coin, and said desperately:</p>

<p>“I want to see the governess—”</p>

<p>“No governess here, sir,” said Buttons, pocketing the
coin. “No children to teach, sir. There’s no lady in
the house but the mistress, Miss Wroat, and she don’t
see no one, sir.”</p>

<p>Rufus stood amazed and bewildered.</p>

<p>“Can I not see Miss Wroat?” he asked. “I wish to
inquire after a young lady whom I supposed to be
here—”</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat can’t be disturbed, sir, on no account,”
said Buttons. “She’s not well, and don’t receive to-day.”</p>

<p>“I will call to-morrow then,” said Rufus, with increasing
desperation. “I must see her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>He descended the steps, and the door closed behind
him.</p>

<p>“Benson must have picked up the wrong card,”
thought Rufus. “Or Lally might have given a wrong
card. Why should she give her employer’s card, unless
indeed she was buying a picture for her employer? I’ll
go back and see Benson.”</p>

<p>He went back, but the picture dealer affirmed that
Lally had given him the card with Miss Wroat’s name
upon it, and Rufus said to himself:</p>

<p>“I have it. Miss Wroat is the sour-looking, servant-like
woman in black, some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenue</i> grown suddenly
rich, and Lally is her companion. This Miss Wroat
knows Lally’s story and despises me. I’ll go back to
Mount street this evening, and see Miss Wroat. When
I tell her the whole truth she will pity me, and allow me
to see Lally, I am sure. I won’t care for poverty or toil
if I can have back my poor little wife. I will fly with
her to some foreign country before my father comes
back. But what did Lally mean by my ‘marriage with
an heiress?’ My father must have told her of Neva.
Why, I’d rather have my poor little Lally than a thousand
haughty Nevas, with a thousand Hawkhursts at
their backs.”</p>

<p>Early in the evening Rufus returned to Mount street,
and Buttons again answered his double knock.</p>

<p>“Family gone away, sir,” said the lad, recognizing
the visitor.</p>

<p>“Where have they gone?” inquired Rufus in sudden
despair.</p>

<p>Buttons declined to answer, and was about to close
the door, when Rufus placed his knee against it and
cried out:</p>

<p>“Boy, I must see Miss Wroat, or her young companion.
If they have gone away, I must follow them. My<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
business with them is imperative. Tell me truthfully
where they have gone, and I will give you this.”</p>

<p>He held up as he spoke a glittering half sovereign.</p>

<p>Buttons hesitated. Clearly he had had his instructions
to betray to no one the course his young mistress
had taken, and just as clearly his virtue wavered before
the glittering bribe offered to him. He reasoned within
himself that no one need ever know that he had told,
and here was an opportunity to make ten shillings
without work. He yielded to the temptation.</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat and Mrs. Peters,” he began, with his
eyes fixed on the coin—“they—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peters? That is what the young companion
calls herself? Go on.”</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat and Mrs. Peters,” repeated the boy,
“they have gone to Heather Hills to stay a month—that’s
where they’ve gone. Now give me my money.”</p>

<p>“In one moment. As soon as you tell me where is
Heather Hills.”</p>

<p>“Scotland,” said the lad. “Inverness. I don’t know
nothing more, only I know the boxes and trunks were
labelled Inverness, for I looked at ’em. The money!”</p>

<p>Rufus paid it, and hurried away, proceeding to the
Great Northern Railway station. When he reached it,
the night express had gone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN ACTIVE RESISTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Neva Wynde was not one to waste her strength in
useless repining, nor to give way to weakness and tears
at a time when she needed all her keenness of wit and
vigor of body, in the contest begun by her enemies. She
was a brave, resolute young girl, and she did not lose her
bravery and resolution even after matters had been so
singularly precipitated to a crisis, and she knew her
enemies as they were. She retired into her own room,
as we have said, and was locked in. As the bolt shot
home and Neva comprehended that she was an actual
prisoner, her cheeks flamed with her indignation at the
indignity practised upon her, but she did not weep or
moan.</p>

<p>She quietly laid aside her fur jacket and hat and went
to her window, essaying to look out. The baying of the
dogs in the yard below reached her ears, and she went
back to her fire, smiling bitterly.</p>

<p>“I see no way of escape,” she murmured. “The night
is cold, and I might die on the mountains in my wanderings,
should I get out. I am in lonely Scottish wilds,
but I am in the hands of Providence, and I will fear no
evil. Surely Arthur will find me out. Craven Black
may be keen-witted, but Arthur is keener. He will find
me.”</p>

<p>She stirred the logs on the hearth to a brighter blaze,
and sat before her fire, until long after she heard the
French woman go to her bed in the ante-room. At last
she arose and barricaded the door with her trunks, and<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
undressed, said her prayers, and went to bed, but not to
sleep.</p>

<p>At the usual hour of the morning she arose and
dressed herself, making her own toilet. When she had
completed it, the door opened and the French woman
entered her presence.</p>

<p>“What, dressed, Mademoiselle?” said Celeste. “I
am come to dress you, but of course I had to dress
Madame and Mrs. Artress first. Mademoiselle is no
longer the first person to be considered and waited upon,
you see. Mademoiselle was first at Hawkhurst;
she is last at the Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Leave the room, Celeste,” said Neva haughtily.
“After your base treachery to me last night, I must decline
your attendance.”</p>

<p>“Madame the step-mamma is to be obeyed, not the
refractory Mademoiselle,” said the French woman insolently.
“If Mademoiselle is not satisfied, the remedy
lies in Mademoiselle’s own hands. The breakfast waits,
and foreseeing that Mademoiselle would be ready for
it, Monsieur and Madam are already in the dining-room.
I will show you the way.”</p>

<p>Neva had not expected to be allowed to leave her
room, and descended at once to the dining-room, closely
attended by Celeste, who gave her not the slightest
chance of escape. The Blacks and Mrs. Artress were in
the dining-room, and addressed Neva courteously; she
responded coldly, and took her seat at the table. Not
a word was spoken on either side during the progress
of the meal, after which Celeste appeared to conduct
Neva back to her room, and the captive was again
locked in.</p>

<p>During Neva’s brief absence her room had been put
in order, and her fire had been freshly made. She sat
down with a book, but she could not read. She took<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
out her drawing materials, but she could not work.
Her thoughts were with her young lover, and she indulged
in speculations as to what he was doing at that
moment, and when he would find her.</p>

<p>At noon, Celeste came in bearing a tray on which was
a plate of bread and a jug of water. She went out
without speaking.</p>

<p>At night, Celeste appeared again with similar refreshments,
and made up the fire afresh, and went out without
speaking. The prison fare and prison treatment on
the silent system was intended to subdue the haughty
young captive, whom her enemies expected to see a suppliant
for mercy in the course of a few hours. They did
not know Neva Wynde. Her proud lip curled, and her
soul rebelled against the meanness and wickedness of
her oppressors, but she ate her dry bread composedly,
and drank the clear water as if it had been wine.</p>

<p>That night, after barricading her door, she went to
bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, when she was dressed and standing
by her window, looking out into the gloom of the
firs and mountain pines that grew near to the house,
and shut out nearly all light and brightness from her
room, her door was unlocked, and Mrs. Craven Black
swept into the apartment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black was attired in a Parisian morning robe of
white cashmere faced with ermine, and lined throughout
with quilted cherry-colored silk. A band of ermine confined
her robe at the waist, and was fastened with a
jewel clasp. Her countenance was supercilious and
domineering, and her eyes gleamed with prospective
triumph.</p>

<p>Neva did not turn from her window after the first
glance at her visitor, but continued to look out into the
gloom, as if unconscious of her visitor’s presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>“Still rebellious, eh?” said Octavia, pausing near the
door, and regarding Neva with smiling insolence. “Are
you not ready to become the obedient step-daughter,
Neva, and to comply with my commands?”</p>

<p>“I shall never be ready to comply with your commands,
madam,” said Neva haughtily.</p>

<p>“Never! Ah, that’s a word with a long meaning,”
said Mrs. Black superciliously. “I think you’ll change
your mind after a little longer imprisonment. How do
you like your Lenten fare? Bread and water is what
they give to contumacious prisoners, and it is found
effective in subduing obstinate tempers. Don’t you
think such meagre diet affects your resolution, Neva?”</p>

<p>The young girl did not answer.</p>

<p>“Sulky? Yes, I see. You are but a child, Neva, rebelling
against rightful authority. Your father enjoined
you to yield me a daughter’s obedience. I have not been
unreasonable, and you should respect my superior knowledge
of the world and my superior wisdom, and give
way to them. You are not yet prepared to do this?”</p>

<p>“As much now as I ever shall be,” said Neva, her eyes
flashing. “Are you really so foolish, Mrs. Black, that
you believe you will force me into perjuring myself? Do
you really think me a child, whom you can coerce or
frighten into obedience to an unjust will? You are mistaken
in me. You will find me at the end of a year as
firm in my refusal to obey you in this same thing, as you
find me now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black looked incredulous.</p>

<p>“My dear Neva,” she said caressingly, “I have just
been down to the dining-room, and have discovered that
we are to have broiled birds on toast, hot rolls and
coffee, for breakfast, with the most delicious Scotch
marmalade made of Seville oranges. It’s a bitter cold
morning, just like January. I can feel the cold wind<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
coming in through your windows. Think of going down
to the breakfast that is prepared for us below. There
is a cover laid for you. Come down with me, Neva, and
after breakfast we will go down to the sloop and start
on our return home. Is not the picture pleasant? Will
you come?”</p>

<p>“I suppose there is a condition attached to partaking
of this breakfast,” said Neva. “You have not relented?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I hoped you had relented,” said Octavia Black,
smiling. “Are you sure I have not tempted you? You
have only to speak one little word, Yes, and you shall
share our breakfast, and we will start for home to-day.”</p>

<p>“You must have a high opinion of me,” said Neva
bitterly. “I will not sell my birthright, madam, for a
mess of pottage. I prefer bread and water to the end of
my days, rather than to become a party in your vile
schemes, or to marry a man I do not love.”</p>

<p>“Then I will send your breakfast up to you,” said Mrs.
Black. “I had hoped that you would go down with us.
But to-morrow morning may not find you so obstinate.”</p>

<p>She retired, and Celeste brought up a tray with bread
and water. The French woman put the room in order
and made up the fire anew, bringing in a huge back-log
herself, which she dragged along upon a reversed chair.
She went out without speaking.</p>

<p>The next day was like this one. Mrs. Black came in
in the morning with her proposals, and retired discomfited.
Then Celeste brought bread and water and put
the room in order, and went out, to return at noon and
evening with more bread and water.</p>

<p>Still Neva did not yield. Her imprisonment was telling
on her strength, but her courage did not lessen.
Her red-brown eyes glowed with courage and resolution
from out a pale face, and her lips wore a smile of patience
and cheerfulness which angered her enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>Upon the fourth morning Neva arose with a determination
to make a bold attempt at escape. She could not
render her condition worse in any event, and perhaps
she might gain her freedom. While she was dressing
she formed a plan, upon the success of which she felt
that her fate depended.</p>

<p>“I begin to believe that Arthur will never find me
here,” she thought. “I must help myself.”</p>

<p>She dressed herself warmly, secured her pocket-book
in her bosom and her jewels on her person, and put on
her fur jacket and round hat. Thus equipped, she
waited at her window with keen nervous anxiety, her ears
live to every sound, and her heart beating like a drum.</p>

<p>At the usual hour Mrs. Black came in alone, as she
usually came.</p>

<p>There was no one in the ante-room, as Neva knew,
Celeste being in attendance upon Mrs. Artress, who grew
more and more exacting of the French woman’s services
with each day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black started as she beheld Neva in out-door
costume, and halted near the door, looking suspiciously
at her captive.</p>

<p>“What! Dressed to go out?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” answered Neva wearily, yet with every
nerve in her slender frame quivering. “I am tired of
this forced inaction. I long for exercise, for the fresh
air, and the songs of birds.”</p>

<p>“You know on what terms you can have these blessings,”
said Octavia Black, still suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, I know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Black’s face brightened. In the girl’s dejected
tone and drooping attitude she believed that she read
her own victory. She came toward Neva, her hard black
eyes shining, her cheeks burning redly, her lips parted in
an exultant smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“My dear child,” she cried, stretching out her hands.
“I was sure the close confinement and prison diet would
bring you to a sense of your duty. I have no reproaches
to offer; I am too happy in the victory I have won. You
have now only to take a solemn oath to marry Rufus
Black on our return to Hawkhurst, and never to betray
this affair at the Wilderness, and we will set out in the
yacht this very morning on our return to Hawkhurst.
You shall—”</p>

<p>Neva did not wait for the sentence to be finished.</p>

<p>With a furtive glance she had seen that the door was
ajar, and that no one was yet in the ante-chamber; and
so, suddenly, with a dart like that of a lapwing, she flew
past Mrs. Black, sprang into the outer room, and locked
the door upon her utterly amazed and stupefied enemy.</p>

<p>Then she sped across the floor of the ante-room and
peeped into the hall.</p>

<p>The upper and lower halls and the stair-way were
alike deserted. By some strange fatality, or providence,
not one of the household was within sight.</p>

<p>Neva fled down the stair-way with the speed and
lightness of an antelope. The front door was ajar. She
pulled it open and darted out upon the lawn, and sped
away amid the gloom of the trees. And as she thus fled,
the loud shrieks of Mrs. Black rang through the house,
rousing Mr. Black in the dining-room, Mrs. Artress and
Celeste, and even the women in the kitchen.</p>

<p>In seemed less than a minute to Neva, when she heard
shouts and cries at the house, the barking of dogs, and
the sounds of pursuit.</p>

<p>Neva dared not venture down to the loch, nor dared
she risk an appeal to the sailors on board the yacht.
Her safety lay in avoiding every one in the vicinity of
the Wilderness, and she turned up the wild mountain<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
side, with the idea of skirting the mountain and descending
to the valley upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>The low-growing mountain shrubbery screened her
from view, but it also impeded her flight. She bounded
on and on, panting and breathless, but a horrible pain
in her side compelled her to slacken her speed, and
finally she proceeded onward at a walk. Her heart
seemed bursting with the thronging life-blood, her head
and body were one great throbbing pulse, and her feet
grew heavy as if clogged with leaden weights.</p>

<p>Unable to proceed further without rest, she sat down
upon a huge boulder under a protecting cliff to rest.
The gray morning scarcely penetrated to the gloomy
spot in which she had halted. The trees were all
around her, and the winds made wild moaning among
their branches. She could see nothing of the Wilderness,
nor of any house. She was lost in the pathless
wild, in the chill gray morning, with a drizzling mist,
as she now for the first time noticed, falling all around
her like a heavy mourning vail.</p>

<p>“At any rate, I am free,” she thought, lifting her pale
wild face to the frowning sky in rapture. “Free! O
God, I thank thee!”</p>

<p>And then, with that prayer of gratitude upon her lips,
with her head raised to ecstacy of joy, there was borne
to her ears the barking of dogs and the loud yells of
men—the sounds of an active and terrible pursuit! The
enemy was close at hand!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NEVA STILL DEFIANT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sounds of active and hostile pursuit, growing
every instant louder as the pursuers neared Neva’s temporary
halting-place, startled the young fugitive into
renewed flight. She started up like a wearied bird from
its nest, and fled onward through tangled shrubbery and
over outcropping boulders, tripping now and then over
some loose rock, which, at the touch of her light feet,
went rumbling down the steep mountain side with a
crash that rang in her ears, frightening her to yet greater
speed. She sped through thickets of the dwarfed mountain
pines and firs, and over open and sterile patches of
ground, where there were no trees nor friendly rocks to
screen her flying figure, and the drizzling Scotch mist
fell around her like a dusky vail, and the skies were
gloomy above her, and the air was keen with wintry
chill.</p>

<p>And still was borne to her ears, sometimes louder,
sometimes fainter, the sounds of the barking of dogs and
the shouts of men. These sounds quickened Neva’s
flagging steps, but she could not outrun her pursuers.
They were on her track, and sooner or later, unless she
could out-wit them, or hide from them, they must capture
her.</p>

<p>Her wild eyes searched the mountain side as she hurried
on. There was no hole in the rocks into which she
might creep, and lie concealed until her enemies should
have passed. The trees were too low and scraggy to
offer her shelter among their few and scanty foliaged
branches. Her way was difficult and tortuous, and with<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
a sudden change of purpose, Neva turned aside from her
course of skirting the mountain, and plunged downward
toward the mountain’s base.</p>

<p>“I shall come down upon the side nearly opposite the
loch,” she thought. “At any rate, I have passed beyond
the plateau.”</p>

<p>In the course of ten minutes more, she struck into a
rude wagon track, which Neva conjectured led from
the Wilderness to some farm-house or hamlet upon the
opposite side of the mountain. She followed the circuitous,
steep, and slowly descending track, looking, as she
ran, like some wild spirit of the mist.</p>

<p>The sounds of pursuit faded out of hearing, and again
she sat down to rest, her limbs giving way beneath her.
Her tongue was parched and swollen, and the blood
surged through her frame still with that one gigantic
throbbing, and her feet ached with an utter weariness,
yet she got up presently and staggered on, with fearing
backward glances over her shoulders, and her eyes staring
wildly from out the wet whiteness of her young face.</p>

<p>“I can’t keep on much longer,” she murmured aloud.
“I feel very strange and ill. Perhaps I shall die here, and
alone. Oh, is there no help for me?”</p>

<p>No answer came to that piteous cry save the wailing of
the winds among the pine boughs, and the dashing of
the sleet-like rain in her face. She moved more and
more slowly. Her garments seemed strangely heavy to
her, and her feet grew more and more like leaden clogs
weighing her down to the earth.</p>

<p>A terrible despair seized upon her. With a wild prayer
on her lips and a faintness like that of death upon her,
she leaned against a low tree, clinging to it to prevent
herself from falling. As her head sunk forward wearily
upon her breast, her closing eyes caught a glimpse
through the trees of an object at a little distance that<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
lent to her for the moment an unreal strength and vigor,
and she gave a great cry of joy, as hope surged back into
her young fainting heart.</p>

<p>The object was only a small cabin built of cobblestones,
a mere shepherd’s hut perhaps, or, as was far more
likely, it had been built long ago for the occasional use
of belated sportsmen who, during a stay at the Wilderness,
found themselves lost upon the mountain. It had
a strong roof and a capacious chimney, but it exhibited
no sign of habitation. Neva did not observe this fact,
and pressed onward to the door of the cabin, which she
opened without preliminary knocking. There was no one
in the cabin.</p>

<p>Neva’s heart sank as she made this discovery. There
was no one here to whom she could appeal for protection.
She hesitated whether to go or to remain here, but her
physical exhaustion decided the question. It was absolutely
necessary that she should rest, and she entered the
humble dwelling and closed the door.</p>

<p>The cabin contained but a single room with two closets
attached, and but a single window. This was provided
with an inside shutter. There was also a stout wooden
bar and iron rests for its support, as a means of securing
the door. Neva barred the door and shuttered the window,
and then sank down in a confused heap upon the
floor, listening with sharpened hearing for some sound of
pursuit.</p>

<p>But she heard none. Evidently her divergence from
her first course had thrown her enemies off her track.
A wild joy and gratitude filled her soul. But when its
first flush was over, a chill like that of death again
seized upon her. Her teeth chattered, and strange
rheumatic pains shot through her frame. She shook
too, as with an ague.</p>

<p>The room was bare of furniture, but the great blackened<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
hearth, with a few half burnt sticks upon it, testified
that some person had lately spent the night in the
cabin. The door of one of the closets was open, and
Neva could see that there were fagots of wood stored
within. She arose feebly, and brought out an armful
of wood, piling it on the hearth. She stirred the ashes,
in the hope of finding a living coal; and finding none,
went back to the closet. Here, to her great joy, she
found a tin box half filled with matches hanging against
the wall.</p>

<p>In three minutes more she had a glorious fire on the
hearth, crackling and blazing and flaming cheerily, and
the girl’s heart leaped up at the sight of those dancing
flames. She sank down upon the hearth, her hands held
out to the genial blaze, her pale wild face looking
strangely weird and lovely in the red glow, and the
steam arising from her wet garments like a thick mist.</p>

<p>A delicious sense of rest pervaded her frame, and the
rheumatic pains disappeared before the penetrating heat
of the great fire. But a terrible sense of weakness remained.
Her prison fare of bread and water, and her
lack of exercise, during her dreary days of confinement
at the Wilderness, had told seriously upon her strength.
She began to fear that she could go no further, and a
great hunger began to assail her, seeming like a vulture
tearing at her vitals.</p>

<p>Impelled by a vague hope that there might be food in
the dwelling, she went to the second small closet. It
was filled with empty shelves. In one corner an old
torn basket had been carelessly thrown. Neva examined
the basket, and discovered in it a small black bottle,
with a few drops of Highland whiskey in it, but there
was no food. She drank the whiskey and crouched
down again upon the hearth, weary and worn, and a little
later a merciful stupor enwrapped her senses—the<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
stupor of a death-like sleep, such as utter exhaustion
sometimes produces.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she had slept but a minute, but
really she had slept for hours, when she was awakened
by a loud beating upon the cabin door. She started up
broad awake, and stood in an attitude of flight, her head
bent toward the door.</p>

<p>“I say she’s in here!” she heard a voice crying loudly—a
voice which she recognized with a thrill of terror as
the voice of Craven Black. “We’ve scoured the mountain
on this side, and have not found her. She must
have taken refuge in this unused cabin. Miss Wynde!
Miss Neva!”</p>

<p>Neva was still as death. She scarcely dared to breathe.</p>

<p>Again Craven Black beat furiously upon the door.</p>

<p>“Break in the door!” he shouted. “Here, one of you
sailors, bring that log of wood yonder, and we’ll see who
has barred this door on the inside. The log of wood!
Quick!”</p>

<p>Neva stared around her with wild, frightened eyes.
There was no outlet from the cabin save through the
door or window, and these were side by side, and both
commanded by her enemies.</p>

<p>With a terrible despair she crouched again on the
hearth, her head still bent toward the door.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a battering-ram of the log,” said Craven
Black. “So! Now the four of us will break the door
in in a second. Guard the door, men, while I go in. Keep
out those sheep dogs. They act like wolves. Now!”</p>

<p>There was a combined assault upon the door. It
trembled and creaked, and one of the iron rests in the
wall, unable to resist the pressure brought to bear upon
it, gave way, bursting from its socket. The wooden bar
dropped to the floor, and the door was burst open so
violently and so suddenly that Craven Black came flying<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
into the room like some projectile hurled from a
mortar.</p>

<p>He gave a yell of triumph at sight of the slender,
crouching figure on the hearth.</p>

<p>“Here she is, boys,” he cried. “We’ve found her!
Poor creature! She is still in the delirium of the fever,
as I told you. How wild she looks!”</p>

<p>The sailors stood without the door, half-careless, half-pitying.
Craven Black had told them that his wife’s
step-daughter was ill, and had fled from the Wilderness
in the delirium of fever, and they saw nothing in Neva’s
appearance to contradict the statement. For the young
girl sprang to her feet and retreated from Craven Black
with both hands upraised, the palms turned outward,
and her wild face full of horror and loathing. Her eyes
were unnaturally bright, and her cheeks and lips were
tinted with vivid carmine. Even Craven Black was
alarmed at her appearance, and was calmed into instant
gentleness.</p>

<p>“My poor Neva!” he cried. “I am come to take you
home—”</p>

<p>“I will not go!” cried the girl, her red-brown eyes
flashing. “O God, am I utterly forsaken and abandoned
to my enemies?”</p>

<p>“You hear her?” exclaimed Black. “Poor thing!
she needs her step-mother’s tender care and nursing.
We brought her up to the Wilderness, hoping that the
change would cure her propensity to these paroxysms.
Come, Neva. Your step-mother is very anxious about
you, and the whole household is alarmed.”</p>

<p>“Let me die here,” said Neva, her sweet young voice
rising to a wail. “Oh, men, have you no pity for me?
Can you not see that Craven Black is my enemy? Will
you not protect me, and set me free? In the name of
Mercy—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Hear her!” said the sailor who had acted as captain
of the yacht, speaking in an audible whisper. “As mad
as a March hare—and so young too!”</p>

<p>Clearly there was no help to be expected from the
sailors.</p>

<p>Neva retreated to the further corner, as a helpless
mouse retreats to a corner of the trap, and Craven Black
followed her. There was a brief struggle, and Neva
was again a captive.</p>

<p>“We must take turns in carrying her home,” said
Craven Black, pinioning Neva’s arms to her sides. “It’ll
be a tough job up the steep mountain path, but we can
do it.”</p>

<p>“It’s no great task,” said one of the seamen. “She
can’t weigh much. She’s fell away since she came to
Scotland, and she can’t be heavier nor a child of ten.”</p>

<p>Craven Black caught up the girl’s light figure, and
bore her from the cabin, the men following. He strode
up the steep hill, holding Neva fiercely to his breast,
and now and then he looked down upon her still white
face with an expression singularly made up of love and
hatred.</p>

<p>Yes, although he had married Lady Wynde from
motives of interest, and because, as he had said to himself,
a half-loaf of bread was better than none at all, his
old love for Neva was not dead in his guilty breast. It
was a strange passion, growing hot and cool by turns,
now verging toward hatred, and now reviving to its
olden strength. As he gathered the girl in his arms,
and went up the hill with her at long, fierce strides, he
said to himself that there was no crime at which he
would pause, no obstacle which he would not sweep
from his path, if the heiress of Hawkhurst would only
promise to marry him on the attainment of his freedom.</p>

<p>“Neva!” he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>The young girl raised her eyes to his with such a look
of loathing and detestation that his love for her changed
suddenly again to hatred. He knew in that moment
that the guilty scheme he had just conceived was only a
vain fancy, and that Neva could never be induced under
any circumstances to marry him.</p>

<p>“I’m tired, captain,” he said abruptly. “You can
carry her.”</p>

<p>The captain took the helpless burden and went on,
Black keeping at his side.</p>

<p>In this manner, taking turns in carrying the young
captive, the party returned to the Wilderness.</p>

<p>The mist was still falling when they came upon the
plateau, but Mrs. Black stood out upon the lawn, her
head bare, her morning robe saturated with wet, and her
face worn and haggard with anxiety. There were great
dark circles under her hard black eyes, and her mouth
was compressed, and there were deep lines about it that
added ten years to her apparent age. What she had
suffered that day from fear of exposure through her injured
step-daughter, her face declared, but she had
known less of remorse than of apprehension and terror.</p>

<p>Behind Octavia, upon the porch, and comfortably
wrapped in a water-proof cloak, stood Mrs. Artress.
Both had thus been watching nearly all the day for the
return of the pursuers, and it was now three o’clock of
the afternoon, and the dusk was rapidly falling.</p>

<p>“They’ve come! They’ve come!” cried Octavia Black
hysterically. “They are alone—No; they have got the
girl! We are safe—safe!”</p>

<p>She came running to meet her husband, who was now
in advance of his men. Craven Black briefly informed
his wife how and where he had found Neva, and at the
porch he took the captive in his own arms, dismissing
the three men to the yacht. He carried Neva to her<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
own room, where Celeste was busy at the moment, and
he unloosed the cord confining the girl’s arms, setting
her free.</p>

<p>There was a wood fire blazing on the hearth. Neva,
paying no heed to her enemies, crouched down before it.</p>

<p>“Leave her to herself,” said Craven Black. “Celeste,
you may remain to dress your young lady—”</p>

<p>“I will dress myself,” interposed Neva, in a low, weary
voice. “I want to be alone.”</p>

<p>“Celeste had better dress Octavia,” exclaimed Mrs.
Artress abruptly. “Octavia has acted like some cowardly,
frightened child all day, Craven. She has stood on the
lawn bare headed, in the mist, until she is wet to the
skin, and has a fearful cold. She is nearly ill.”</p>

<p>“I will have hot drinks prepared immediately,” said
Craven Black. “Octavia, you must take a hot bath.
Celeste, bring a hot bath to Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p>He led the way from the room, the others following.
Celeste locked Neva’s door, putting the key in her
pocket. Octavia went to her own room, coughing dismally.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that?” demanded Mrs. Artress, stopping
Craven Black in the hall. “Exercise has prevented
any serious harm to Miss Wynde from to-day’s exposure;
but Octavia has taken a fearful cold. You’d better
nurse her carefully. In your desire to get ten thousand
a year more, don’t throw away the four thousand
you already have. Remember, if Octavia should die,
you and I would be beggars!”</p>

<p>“What an infernal croaker you are!” said Black
angrily. “It isn’t necessary to twit me with my poverty.
As to Octavia, if she’s foolish enough to stand out in a
chilling mist out of sheer cowardice, let her cure herself.
I am cold and hungry, and I intend to take care of myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>He proceeded to do so, ministering to his own wants
with assiduity.</p>

<p>The French woman brought in a hot bath to Neva,
and a bowl of steaming hot whisky punch, then hastening
away to attend upon her mistress. Neva took her
bath, changed her wet garments for dry ones, drank her
punch, and went to bed. A free perspiration was induced,
and the fever that had threatened her subsided,
her pulse beat evenly, and her brain grew cool. She
went to sleep, and did not awaken until late in the evening.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes, Mrs. Artress was standing
at her bedside, feeling her pulse.</p>

<p>“How do you feel?” demanded the woman, her ashen
eyes surveying the girl insolently.</p>

<p>“I am quite well—only tired.”</p>

<p>“Only tired!” echoed Mrs. Artress. “Only tired—after
all the trouble you’ve made us to-day? Octavia is
downright ill. You won’t get another opportunity to
repeat your proceeding of this morning, my fine young
lady. Celeste is with me, and hereafter we two shall
call upon you together. Octavia was foolish to come in
here alone, but she did not know you so well this morning
as she does now. We have brought you up a hot
supper, by Craven’s orders, but in the morning you go
back to the bread and water diet, if you choose to remain
obstinate.”</p>

<p>Celeste was standing at the foot of the bed, and now
wheeled forward a small table, on which were lighted
candles and a large tray of food. This done, Mrs. Artress
and the French woman went out together, locking
the door behind them.</p>

<p>Neva sat up in bed, leaning against her pillows, and
looked hungrily at the tray. There was a pot of steaming
coffee, a plate of buttered hot scones, a dish filled<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
with daintily broiled birds on toast, a dish of baked fish,
and a basket filled with oranges, apples and grapes.
Neva thought she had never beheld a meal so tempting
in her life, and surely she had never been so famished.
Craven Black had feared the result of her day’s exposure
on the bleak mountain to the chilling mist, upon her
weakened frame, and had sent her strengthening food
more from policy than pity. It was not to his interest
that she should die.</p>

<p>Neva ate her dinner, or supper, as it might more properly
be termed, and concealed the remnants of fowl in
her trunk. It was well she did so, for the next morning
Celeste brought to her only a meagre supply of bread
and water. The remains of the wild fowls and of the
whisky punch, however, were produced by the young
girl when alone, and gave her the sustenance she
needed.</p>

<p>Her limbs were somewhat stiff upon the day after her
adventure on the mountain, but this stiffness wore off
gradually, leaving her as well as ever.</p>

<p>Her diet continued meagre in the extreme, no change
being afforded her from bread and water. Mrs. Artress
and Celeste came to her once a day with food, Craven
Black remaining in the ante-room during their visit, as
a guard against another possible attempt at escape on
the part of the young captive.</p>

<p>A week passed in this manner, before Octavia Black
came again to Neva’s room. But what a change in her
that week had wrought! She had grown thin, and her
features were worn to sharpness. A red flush burned fitfully
on her cheeks, and her hard black eyes were
strangely glittering. She had lost many of the graces
that had distinguished her, and looked what she was—a
bold, unscrupulous, unprincipled woman. Neva could
not particularize in what her charm of person and manner<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
had lain, but those charms were now gone. She
looked ten years older than her age, and coughed like a
consumptive.</p>

<p>“What have you to say to-day, Neva?” asked Octavia,
in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Neva calmly.</p>

<p>“You have put us to a terrible trouble; you have
given me a horrible cold and cough; and yet you sit
here as obstinate as if you were a princess and we were
your subjects. Will nothing subdue your proud spirit?
Will nothing bend your haughty will? Do you like
bread and water and close confinement so well that you
prefer them to a marriage with a handsome young man
who adores you?”</p>

<p>“I prefer them to perjuring myself, madam,” said
Neva bravely. “I prefer a brief imprisonment to a
lifetime of sorrow and repining.”</p>

<p>“A brief imprisonment!” repeated Octavia. “It won’t
be so brief as you think. We are going to remain here
all winter, if necessary to subdue you. We have
entered on a path from which there is no turning back.
The winters, I am told, are fearful in these wild Highlands.
We shall soon be shut in with snows and awful
winds. Your lover can never trace you here, and if he
could he would not be able to reach the Wilderness in
the dead of winter. We shall have a dismal winter—you
especially. What do you say, Neva?” and her tone grew
anxious. “Will you yield?”</p>

<p>“Never!” said Neva quietly. “I am no child to be
frightened by cold, and I am not so fond of the pleasures
of the table as to sell my soul for them. I will live
here till I die of old age before I will yield!”</p>

<p>Octavia Black’s face darkened with an awful shadow.
She dreaded the terrible Highland winter; and a strange
terror, for which she could not account, held possession<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
of her soul night and day. But, as she had said, she
had entered on a path from which there was no turning
back. Neva <em>must</em> yield, sooner or later, she said to herself,
even if compelled to yield through physical weakness.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Mrs. Black, arising. “We will
make preparations to spend the winter here. Craven
will go to Inverness in the yacht one day this week, and
purchase stores for our use during the cold season. We
need blankets, and food of every description. If you
should decide to go to Inverness with him, as the
promised bride of Rufus Black, you have only to let me
know before he sails.”</p>

<p>She went out and locked the door, giving the key to
Celeste, who waited in the outer room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MORE TROUBLE IN THE HIGHLANDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Upon the afternoon of the same day on which occurred
the interview between Octavia Black and young
Neva Wynde, as detailed at the conclusion of the preceding
chapter, Lally Bird, attended by Mrs. Peters,
arrived at Inverness, having come up from London by
easy stages.</p>

<p>It was a week after Neva’s wild flight among the
mountains of Ross-shire, but a fine, thick rain, like that
through which Neva had so fruitlessly wandered, was
falling like a dusky pall. The sky was dark and frowning,
the air was chill and heavy, and the streets were
dismal with the rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>There was no carriage in waiting to convey the travelers
to their destination, and they entered a cab and
were conveyed to the Caledonian Hotel, where they
passed the night.</p>

<p>The next morning, the mist was still falling thickly, in
a dreary, drizzling, listless fashion, as if it never intended
to leave off. Lally looked out of her sitting-room
window, into the gloomy streets, and said:</p>

<p>“I fear it was a foolish idea to come to Scotland, and
so far north too, at this season. And yet I wanted to
come.”</p>

<p>“It was the best thing we could do,” said Mrs. Peters.
“You were just pining to death in that great London
house, Miss Lally.”</p>

<p>“But if we had remained there, I might have seen
Rufus again, perhaps,” said the girl regretfully. “How
shocked he seemed to be at beholding me! He stared
at me as at a ghost. I suppose he has long ago ceased
to love me. He loves another now. And yet, Mrs.
Peters, for the sake of the dear old days when I was all
the world to him, he might have followed me to the carriage—he
might have traced us home.”</p>

<p>“I told him that you were a poor governess, Miss,”
said Peters, who had not informed her young mistress
of Rufus Black’s visit to Mount street, having conceived
a cordial dislike to Lally’s young husband. “P’raps
the young gentleman had to go back to his heiress that
he is engaged to marry? Surely, Miss Lally, you
wouldn’t take him back, and he engaged to another
lady?”</p>

<p>Lally’s brown cheek flushed, and a sudden light
leaped to her black eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, Peters,” she said softly. “He was not
so much to blame as you think. His father forced him
to give me up. He’s only a boy, Peters, and this is his<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
birthday. He is twenty-one to-day. How he used to
talk of his birthday; quite as if he were a lord, and
expected to come into a property upon this day. He
was weak and cowardly, but you could see how he had
suffered, Peters. He will marry this beautiful and
grand young lady, a baronet’s daughter, and he’ll go to
court, and his bride will worship him; while I—”</p>

<p>She paused, sighing heavily.</p>

<p>“While you marry some great man, and go to court
also, Miss Lally,” said Peters.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“He wrote that I am not his wife,” she said, “but if I
am not his wife, I shall never be the wife of any one
else. I thought I was truly his wife, Peters, and I loved
him as such, and a woman cannot unlove where she has
loved with her whole soul. I shall consider myself in
my own heart as the wife of Rufus so long as I live.
His grand young bride cannot love him as I love him—my
poor wronged boy! He would have been true to me
always if his father had let him alone.”</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Peters could reply there was a knock on
the door, and Toppen, Lally’s London footman, entered,
his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>“The Heather Hills carriage waits, Miss Wroat,” he
announced respectfully. “The horses have been baited,
and are fresh for the journey. We left the Hills yesterday,
but broke down on the way, and did not get into
Inverness until the evening, when we came to this hotel
and found your name registered, and that you had retired
for the night. The carriage has been put in repair,
and we can leave at any hour it may please you.”</p>

<p>“We will go now,” said Lally. “Have the luggage
taken down, Toppen. We will follow.”</p>

<p>She rung for the hotel bill, and paid it. The luggage
was carried down, and Lally put on her wrappings and<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
bonnet and vail. Mrs. Peters also hastily attired herself,
and they descended to the waiting vehicle.</p>

<p>The Heather Hills carriage proved to be an old-fashioned,
cumbrous coach, painted green, and with
wheels heavy enough for a luggage cart. It had a stout
roof, upon which the luggage was piled. Lally was assisted
into the coach, Mrs. Peters entered after her, the
windows were drawn up nearly to the top, the footman
mounted beside the coachman, who cracked his whip,
and away the equipage went, to the edification of
several small boys and hotel waiters.</p>

<p>There were plenty of lap blankets and traveling rugs,
and Lally rolled herself snugly in a corner, and rubbing
a spot on the window glass, tried to look out into the
streets as they passed. Mrs. Peters also rolled herself
up comfortably, and was silent.</p>

<p>The estate of Heather Hills was situated on the coast,
between Fort George and Nairn—much nearer to Nairn
in fact, than to Inverness—but the drive was pleasant in
good weather, and the late Mrs. Wroat had always proceeded
by carriage from Inverness, a good and sufficient
reason why her successor should do so.</p>

<p>The house at Heather Hills was old and picturesque,
with a lofty tower that commanded a fine view of Moray
Frith. It was of mixed styles of architecture, and was
home-like, while it was imposing. The estate took its
name from a low range of hills covered with heather,
which formed a portion of its boundaries; but these hills
were at a considerable distance from the house, which
stood upon a tall and naked bluff, overlooking the Frith.</p>

<p>In summer the house was fanned with the salt sea-breezes,
making it a delightful retreat. Seen, however,
through a Scotch mist upon a day in late October, under
a frowning sky, and with the dreariness of coming winter
already apparent in the grounds, it was not so delightful.<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
It looked cold, wind-swept, and deserted, to Lally,
as she lowered her window and took a survey of her
domain.</p>

<p>Around the house was a wide and fine lawn dotted
with trees. There were flower-gardens, and the usual
appanages to a fine country seat; but Lally’s regards
were fixed upon the mansion, which, wrapped in gray
mist, seemed to its new owner one of the grandest as
well as one of the loveliest houses she had ever seen.</p>

<p>The carriage passed up the long winding drive and
halted in the wide porch. Toppen sprang nimbly down
from the box, threw off his Mackintosh, and opened the
coach door, assisting its occupants to alight.</p>

<p>Then he flung open the house door and led the way
up the steps into the great hall, while the carriage went
around to the stables.</p>

<p>In the wide hall the steward and his wife were waiting,
to welcome the new owner of Heather Hills.</p>

<p>The former was a hale, sandy-haired Scotsman, with
a plain honest face. The latter was a broad-faced motherly
Scots-woman, who fell in love with the young mistress
of the house at first sight.</p>

<p>“Miss Wroat,” said Peters, “these are Mr. and Mrs.
Lang, the steward and his wife.”</p>

<p>Lally acknowledged the introduction with a gentle
courtesy that won the Scotsman’s heart.</p>

<p>“The house is all in order, Miss,” he said respectfully.
“There’s a cook and house-maid from Inverness, and
new furniture has been put in your own room, Miss, and
your sitting room has been newly furnished, as Mrs.
Peters ordered. If the house is not to your liking, anything
can be changed as you wish.”</p>

<p>“I will show you up to your room, Miss,” said Mrs.
Lang, noticing Lally’s pallor, and evident weariness.
“Dinner will be on the table in an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>Lally and Peters followed the steward’s wife to the
upper hall, and to a large octagon chamber, newly fitted
up with a crimson carpet, crimson-covered chairs, and a
cottage piano. A wood fire burned on the hearth, and an
easy-chair in a white slip cover was drawn up before it.</p>

<p>“How cozy and pleasant!” exclaimed Lally. “All is
warmth and brightness in here, but I can look from my
windows upon the wild sea, white with fury. See the
sails! I shall never tire of this charming room and
charming prospect.”</p>

<p>“Your bed-room adjoins this room, Miss Wroat,” said
Mrs. Lang, well pleased with Lally’s praise. “Mrs.
Peters’ room is next beyond, and opens into yours.”</p>

<p>“Do you live in the house, Mrs. Lang?” asked Lally.</p>

<p>“No, Miss. We live at the cottage half a mile back,
which you passed just before turning into the grounds.
We have lived there twenty years. No other spot in the
world seems so like home to us. If we had to leave it
now,” and Mrs. Lang’s voice trembled, “I think my old
man would just fret himself to death.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to leave it,” said Lally cheerfully.
“I do not intend that my aunt’s old friends or faithful
servants shall suffer through me. I desire Mr. Lang to
continue his stewardship so long as he lives and I live.
I do not know anything about the revenue or this little
estate; Mr. Harris forgot to mention it perhaps;
but I am sure it cannot be in better hands than those in
which my aunt placed it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lang looked relieved and gratified.</p>

<p>“The estate has yielded some three hundred a year to
Mrs. Wroat, after all salaries were paid,” she explained.
“It is not as profitable as most places of its size, but it
has served as a grand country seat in its day, and the
grounds are very extensive and beautiful. The house
and outbuildings are in perfect repair; there is a pair<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
of carriage horses, besides the work animals; and there
are a fine lot of sheep and cattle of the best breeds, and
they can be made a source of greater revenue if you
are willing to go to some outlay for stock.”</p>

<p>“We will see to all that,” said Lally beginning to feel
an interest in her new possession. “I would like to talk
with Mr. Lang about it some day when he has leisure.
I wish you and Mr. Lang would remain to dinner with
us.”</p>

<p>The steward’s wife accepted the invitation with delight,
and went down to acquaint her husband with his
prospects for the future.</p>

<p>Lally made her toilet, with Mrs. Peters’ assistance.</p>

<p>“I can see my future,” said Lally, with the first gleam
of brightness Mrs. Peters had seen in her black eyes and
on her gypsy face since Mrs. Wroat’s death. “I dare
say I shall in time go to town and the house in Mount
street for three months in the year; and I shall live here
at Heather Hills, and raise prize pigs and prize sheep
and prize Highland cattle, and look out of the windows
at the sails; and so the years will pass and I shall grow
gray. And, oh, I’ll get up a charity school of some sort
and teach it myself; and the children, instead of being
disfigured with baglike blouses and horrid starched
caps, shall all wear the prettiest pink and blue dresses,
according to their complexions, and the prettiest white
ruffled aprons; and when I die they shall stand in two
rows around my grave, and may be somebody will say
that I was ‘a mother in Israel.’”</p>

<p>It was not a very bright picture of the future of one
so young and pretty as Lally, with fortune and all
good gifts. She seemed intended for a home fairy, to
cheer and uphold and strengthen a kindly, loving husband;
to gather little children of her own to her breast;<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
and good Mrs. Peters could not help praying that such
might be Lally’s destiny.</p>

<p>When the young mistress of Heather Hills had
changed her black bombazine traveling dress for a black
lustreless silk trimmed heavily with crape, and provided
with white crape ruffles at the throat, and had put on
her jet jewelry, she was ready for dinner. Her black
hair had been gathered into braids, and was ornamented
with a black bow, and she looked as she was, gentle, refined,
intelligent, weighted with sorrow too heavy for
her to bear, yet meek and patient as some young martyr.</p>

<p>“We will go down now to our guests, Peters,” she
said. “How soon will you be ready?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters’ face flushed.</p>

<p>“Miss Lally,” she said hesitatingly, “it is not suitable
I should dine with you. I am only your maid, you
know. Mrs. Wroat had me always dine with her, because
otherwise she must have dined alone, and she liked
company. Mr. Lang is the younger son of a Scottish
laird, and he might be affronted to dine with me.”</p>

<p>“But I insist,” said Lally.</p>

<p>“No, no, Miss Lally. When you are alone, I’ll dine
with you for company,” said Mrs. Peters stoutly, “but
I assure you I would rather eat by myself when there’s
company. I won’t have any one say that my young
mistress doesn’t know what is suitable to her station.
If I could, I’d set you up on a pedestal above everybody
else; indeed I would, Miss Lally. I would like to be
housekeeper here, and manage the servants, but I can’t
dine with you when there’s company.”</p>

<p>“You shall do as you please, Peters,” said Lally.
“You are my friend as well as my maid—my only friend,
Peters. If you don’t like to dine with company, you<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
shall dine where you please. There, give me a kiss
Peters, and I’ll go down.”</p>

<p>Peters gave the desired kiss, with many additional
ones, and wiped her eyes as Lally went out, and muttered:</p>

<p>“She is just the bonniest, sweetest young lady that
ever lived. If that young gentleman comes up here to
see her, he’ll go away with a flea in his ear—see if he
don’t.”</p>

<p>Lally went down to her guests and talked with them
until the dinner bell rung. Mr. Lang offered her his
arm with quite the air of a man of fashion, giving his
wife his other arm, and the three went in to dinner.</p>

<p>The dining-room was long and low, with two great
wood fires on capacious hearths, and a seven-windowed
oriel overhanging the sea. It was bright with ruddy
colors and fine china and gleaming silver, and the dinner
upon the oval table was in keeping with the room.
It was a feast fit for a princess, and had been ordered by
Mrs. Lang, with a view to presenting to the heiress of
Heather Hills as many varieties of birds and game and
fish off her estate as could be obtained.</p>

<p>After dinner, Lally had a long business conversation
with Mr. Lang, and repeated the promise she had already
given the steward’s wife. She appointed another
interview with the steward for the following day, and
about dusk the visitors took their leave.</p>

<p>Lally spent the evening playing upon her piano, in
singing, and in thought.</p>

<p>The next morning she walked over to the steward’s
cottage, and made a brief visit. The day was dark and
gloomy, but it did not rain. In the afternoon the steward
came up to the great house to see Lally, and he
remained until nearly dinner. At five o’clock, Lally and
Mrs. Peters dined together in the dining-room overlooking<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
the sea, a dozen candles lighted and sending
their bright gleams out over the troubled waters.</p>

<p>“You look better to-night, Miss Lally,” said her faithful
attendant. “You will find new interests up in this
region, and will find that you have something to live for
yet.”</p>

<p>Lally smiled sadly but did not answer.</p>

<p>They still lingered in the dining-room, Lally standing
in the great oriel window and looking out upon the sea,
which was being furiously beaten by the winds, when
Mrs. Peters heard a carriage come up the drive and halt
in the carriage porch.</p>

<p>The good woman’s face turned pale. She glanced at
her young mistress, but Lally heard no sound save the
tumult of the winds and the waves.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild night,” said the young girl. “I don’t
see a sail in the Frith. The boats have all made for
harbor.”</p>

<p>At that moment a double knock was heard upon the
front door, and Mrs. Peters heard the housekeeper going
to the door.</p>

<p>But Lally’s face was pressed against the cold glass,
and she did not hear the summons for admittance.</p>

<p>“The wind is rising,” the girl said, with a shudder.
“I see a steamer coming in. She’ll make port just in
time. I would not like to be on the sea to-night.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters heard the front door open.</p>

<p>With a nervous glance at her young mistress, she stole
out into the hall.</p>

<p>The front door was open, and a gust of wind was
sweeping through the hall like a hurricane. Upon
the threshold a man wearing a greatcoat and broad-brimmed
artist’s hat, a man with a slender figure and
eager face, was standing, talking with the house-maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Peters recognized the unwelcome guest as Rufus
Black.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mrs. Peters,” he was saying earnestly—“Miss
Wroat’s companion. I have come up expressly
from London to see her. I cannot go back to Inverness
without seeing Mrs. Peters. She is my wife!”</p>

<p>“Lawks, sir!” said the housemaid, with a wild idea
that her visitor was a lunatic.</p>

<p>The reader, who knows how naturally Rufus Black’s
mistake had arisen, will not wonder at it.</p>

<p>“I must see her,” persisted Rufus, his voice trembling.
“Tell Mrs. Peters a gentleman wishes to see her—”</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Peters, grim and terrible, resolving
to protect her young mistress from one she
deemed unworthy of her, marched out into the full glare
of the hall lamp, and placing her arms akimbo, and assuming
her most warlike aspect, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, sir! and what may you want of me, sir? <em>I</em>
am Mrs. Peters!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE DESPAIR OF RUFUS AND LALLY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At the grim and warlike announcement of Mrs. Peters’
identity, delivered in Mrs. Peters’ grimmest and most
warlike manner, Rufus Black recoiled involuntarily, his
face expressing his utter amazement.</p>

<p>He had felt confident that this angular and sour-visaged woman
was Miss Wroat, and that his deserted
young wife was in the woman’s employ, under the assumed
name of Mrs. Peters. In his astonishment and
disappointment, he stood pale and speechless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>“You may go down, Mary,” said Mrs. Peters to the
housemaid. “The gentleman came to see me, you
hear.”</p>

<p>The housemaid, being in awe of Mrs. Peters, precipitately
retired to the servants’ hall.</p>

<p>“And now, sir,” said Mrs. Peters, in such a voice as
she might have employed in uttering a challenge, “what
may you want with me?”</p>

<p>Rufus Black struggled to regain his self-control.</p>

<p>“There is some mistake,” he gasped. “I—I remember
you. I saw you in the Regent street picture-shop
the other day, with—with a young lady. I thought she
called herself Mrs. Peters. I am come to see her.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Mrs. Peters, who was in inward terror
of Lally’s appearance upon the scene, and who had
made up her mind to prevent an interview between the
young pair at all costs. “Come in, sir, and I’ll hear
what you have to say.”</p>

<p>She conducted him to the library, which was across
the hall from the drawing-rooms. It was lighted by a
pendant chandelier, in which were a dozen wax candles
which burned with mellow light. A great circular bay-window
took up one side of the apartment, the opposite
side containing a great fire-place, in which logs were
burning. The angles on either side the chimney were
fitted with tall book-cases, and one end of the room was
also lined with rows of shelves well filled with books, and
protected by plate-glass doors. At the opposite end of
the room was a glazed garden door, opening upon the
grassy terrace.</p>

<p>This room already bid fair to become a favorite resort
of Lally. She had ordered it to be warmed and lighted
at the same time with the drawing-room, and was likely
to visit it during the evening. Mrs. Peters locked the
door, therefore, as she motioned Rufus to a seat. He declined<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
the civility, however, and remained standing, his
hat in his hand.</p>

<p>“I remember you very well now,” said Mrs. Peters,
pretending to search her memory, “now that you have
mentioned the picture-shop. You are the young gentleman
who annoyed the young lady with me? Yes, I remember
you. What are you doing here? Why have you
followed us to Scotland? Why have you come to
Heather Hills?”</p>

<p>“I am come, madam,” cried Rufus, white and agitated,
“to see the young lady who was in your company at
Benson’s the other day. It is imperative that I should
see her.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Mrs. Peters gravely. “In the first
place, how can you be sure that the young lady is in this
house?”</p>

<p>“I have traced her and you all the way from London,”
cried Rufus. “I saw the card you gave to Benson, with
the name upon it of ‘Miss Wroat, Mount street,’ with the
number. I went to Mount street twice, and the second
time discovered that you had left town. I hurried to the
station of the great Northern, and found that the express
had gone. And then—”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I went to my hotel. I had not money enough for such
a trip as this,” said Rufus frankly, “and so I could not
come on the morning train. I had to sell my watch, a
recent present from my father, and as I had then all day
on my hands before I could start for the north, I went
to Mount street again. In one of the streets near, I inquired
at a shop about Miss Wroat, and there learned
that she was an eccentric old lady—excuse me, madam,
but I received a very accurate description of <em>you</em>. And
so I knew that you were Miss Wroat, and that Lally is
Mrs. Peters. I took the night train for Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
twenty-four hours later than yourself. I reached Inverness
this afternoon, and discovered the names of Miss
Wroat and Mrs. Peters registered at the Caledonian. A
servant of the house told me that you were at Heather
Hills, and a cabman brought me here. I know that Lally
is in this house, madam, and I must see her!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters smiled grimly as a full comprehension of
Rufus Black’s mistake dawned upon her. She understood
readily that the shopman whom Rufus had interrogated
had not known of Mrs. Wroat’s death, and had
confounded the names of Mrs. Wroat and Miss Wroat,
and that Rufus very naturally thought her the “eccentric
old lady” of whom he had heard.</p>

<p>“And so you don’t believe that I am Mrs. Peters?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” said Rufus bluntly. “I have traced an
elderly lady—yourself—and a young girl—Lally—all the
way from London, and under the names of Miss Wroat
and Mrs. Peters. You are not Mrs. Peters, and I demand
to see her.”</p>

<p>“You can not see her,” said Mrs. Peters stoutly. “I
have heard the young lady’s story, and I shall protect
her from the persecutions of a man who deserted her in
the most cowardly fashion, and who, believing her to be
dead, never made one movement to save her supposed
remains from interment in a pauper’s grave. You have
no claim upon Miss Bird, Mr. Rufus Black; you have
yourself declared that she is not your wife.”</p>

<p>“Lally has told you all?” cried Rufus, in a low, heart-broken
voice. “Not all though, for even she does not
know all—the sleepless nights I’ve passed, the days of
anguish! I’ve hated myself, and despised myself. I
have been on the point again and again of committing
suicide. Her poor young face, as I fancied it, mutilated
and dead, has haunted me sleeping and waking. God<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
alone knows my anguish, my remorse! If Lally only
knew all!”</p>

<p>“She knows more than you think,” said Mrs. Peters
significantly.</p>

<p>“How? What? I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bird has a shelter under this roof now, and
while I live she shall never want a friend,” said Mrs.
Peters, purposely confirming Rufus Black’s impression
that Lally was a dependent, “but she has known such
extremes of poverty as would make you shudder. She
left her lodgings in New Brompton, turned out by an
insolent landlady, having only the clothes she stood in.
She went out upon Waterloo Bridge in her despair, to
commit suicide. An unfortunate girl did commit suicide,
springing from Lally’s very side and Lally’s handkerchief
fluttering after the poor lost creature fixed upon
her Lally’s identity. Lally fled from the terrible scene,
and that night she slept upon Hampstead Heath, under
the open sky, with tramps and thieves all around her in
the darkness, and she knowing it not—homeless, houseless,
penniless—”</p>

<p>“O Heaven!” cried Rufus Black, in an uncontrollable
agitation.</p>

<p>“You think it terrible for a girl so young and beautiful?
Listen. Worse was to come. She went to a poor
old seamstress she had known when teaching music in a
school. This seamstress gave her shelter and protection,
but she was dying of consumption, and Lally had soon
to work for her and nurse her, and after a little to bury
her. When the poor woman died, Lally was once more
homeless, and without work. She was nearly starved,
and her one great desire was to look upon your face
again, herself unseen. And so she wandered down into
Kent—”</p>

<p>“Into Kent? Oh, my poor girl!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>“She was ragged and tattered, hungry and forlorn.
She worked in the hop-gardens for food and shelter.
She saw you—”</p>

<p>Rufus uttered a cry of incredulity.</p>

<p>“She did not see me!” he ejaculated. “I should
have known her in any guise. I should have felt her
nearness, had she been on the opposite side of the
street.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters’ lip curled.</p>

<p>“You think so?” she said dryly. “Let me tell you
that your wronged and deserted young wife was nearer
to you than that, and yet you did not know it. Do you
remember a certain September evening when you sat
beside the heiress of Hawkhurst upon a way-side bank,
in the shadow of Hawkhurst park? Do you remember
your passionate vows of love to Miss Wynde? Do you
remember telling Miss Wynde that your very life here
and beyond depended upon her answer to your suit?
Well, there was one listening to those passionate vows
whom you thought dead. In the thicket, almost within
an arm’s length of you, a poor worn-out, ragged tramp
was lying for a brief rest—a hungry, houseless, tattered
tramp, Mr. Black—and that tramp was your disowned
young wife!”</p>

<p>“O my God! Impossible!”</p>

<p>“You passed on with your beautiful new love in all
her pride and her beauty, and the old love rose up from
her thorny bed and crept after you like a shadow, and
when you stood in the light upon the Hawkhurst terrace,
with the hand of your new love pressed to your
lips, the old love stood outside the great gates a long
way off, and with her face against the bars looked in
upon you both, as a lost soul might look in upon Paradise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lally, Lally!” cried Rufus, in a wild anguish,<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
utterly losing his self-control. “Lally! Was she there?
My poor, poor darling!”</p>

<p>“When you turned to come back down the avenue,
she fled moaning. She had seen you, and it seemed as
if she must die. But she was young and strong, and
life clung to her, although her heart was breaking. She
wandered on for hours, and finally lay down under a
wayside hedge. The next day she worked in hop-gardens,
and the next night she slept in a barn with the
hop-pickers, many of whom are tramps and thieves out
of London for a holiday. She earned a little money,
and went to Canterbury and advertised for a situation,
which she obtained—”</p>

<p>“As your companion, madam? May God in heaven
bless you for your goodness to my poor forsaken girl!
And she lived and suffered while I mourned her as dead.
Oh, madam, I can explain all that seems so strange to
you and her. I never loved Miss Wynde as I loved Lally.
I believed Lally dead, and that I was her murderer. I
was consumed with remorse and anguish. I was desperate,
and going to the bad, and I prayed Miss Wynde to
save me. But I loved only Lally. I pray you to let me
see her. She will believe me—”</p>

<p>“That is the very reason I shall not permit you to see
her. She is getting to take an interest in life, and I will
not have her growing peace disturbed. You are engaged
to this heiress—”</p>

<p>“O no, I am not. And if I were I would not marry her
now that I know that Lally lives. My father threatened
me with arrest and imprisonment if I did not give Lally
up. He assured me that the marriage was null and
void, and that he would provide for my poor girl. I’m
a coward, Miss Wroat, a poor, pitiful coward, and I have
had all my life long a deadly fear of my father. You
cannot understand that fear; perhaps no one can; but I<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
shall fling off that awe and terror of him, and be henceforth
my own master. I was one-and-twenty yesterday,
madam, and I am now accountable alone to God and to
the laws of my country. I love Lally, and Lally alone,
in all the world. I am going to try to be worthy of her.
She is poor, and I am poor; but if she will take me
back again,” said Rufus, humbly, “we will begin life
anew, and I will try to be a better man. I will work for
her, and I’ll try to be a great painter, so that she may be
proud of me. And if I can’t be that, I’ll be anything
that is honest and manly to earn our support. I know
you have a poor opinion of me, madam, and I know I
deserve it. I don’t amount to much from any point of
view, but if you would intercede for me with Lally, and
beg her to try me again and marry me, I will bless you
always as my benefactress and savior.”</p>

<p>The young man’s humility and anguished pleading
touched the heart of Mrs. Peters, but she steeled herself
against him, and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Black, I am sorry for you. I believe that you
mean what you say now, but if you were once to get
under your father’s influence again, Miss Lally would be
as unhappy as ever. I advise you to go back to Miss
Wynde, and leave Lally here. In time she may marry
an honorable and upright gentleman, with whom she
will be far happier than she could be with you.”</p>

<p>A quick flush of jealousy overspread the youth’s face.
His eyes glared at Mrs. Peters with a hunted expression.</p>

<p>“She won’t marry again until I die, or the law has
freed her from me,” he exclaimed. “I would never
have proposed marriage to Miss Wynde, had I not supposed
Lally to be dead. She is my wife, madam, and
I’ll declare her to be such until she herself forbids me to
do so. If she marries any other man I’ll kill him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>The young man’s jealous fury was succeeded by an
instant and terrible despair.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said humbly. “What am I, to
talk of controlling Lally’s movements? I have forfeited
all claim upon her and upon her forgiveness. If she refuses
to take me back, I can only go to perdition. If
she will stretch out her hand to save me, I will be her
slave. Will you not take a brief message to her from
me, madam—only a few words?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters fancied she heard a light step in the hall.
She listened, but convinced of her mistake, said nervously
and hastily:</p>

<p>“I cannot convey your message, sir. I entreat you
to leave Miss Bird in peace. I repeat that you cannot
see her under this roof.”</p>

<p>“How summarily you dispose of the happiness and
the very destiny of a fellow-being!” said Rufus despairingly
and reproachfully. “I would see her in your presence—”</p>

<p>“You cannot. You have prolonged this interview
beyond bounds, sir. Take my advice and go back to
Miss Wynde. I must bid you a good-evening, Mr.
Black. You can go out at this garden door, if you
please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters threw open the garden door, and a gust
of chill wind swept in, nearly extinguishing the lights.
Rufus hesitated, but the door remained open, and Mrs.
Peters looked so grim and stern that he obeyed her
without a murmur, and went out in a dead silence, his
wild eyes giving her a last look of reproach and despair.</p>

<p>A minute later, she heard his cab roll away from the
house.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I have done right,” the woman muttered
uneasily, as she closed the door. “I have taken a great<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
responsibility upon myself in deciding the fate of my
young mistress. I almost wish that I had let him see
her, but she is so young and tender and pitiful, she
would be sure to take him back again. His eyes will
haunt me. He looked as a man might look on his way
to execution.”</p>

<p>At that moment the library door was tried from the
hall, and an imperious little knock sounded upon the
panels.</p>

<p>“Peters,” cried Lally, from without, in an agitated
voice, “let me in! let me in!”</p>

<p>Peters calmed her face, and hastened to unlock the
door.</p>

<p>Lally swept in impetuously, her gypsy face aglow, her
black eyes full of fire, her chest panting. She held in
one hand a gentleman’s glove, which she had just
picked up from the hall floor.</p>

<p>Her keen eyes swept the room, and her countenance
fell with disappointment at finding Mrs. Peters alone.</p>

<p>“I heard a carriage go away just now, Peters,” she
cried. “Who has been here?”</p>

<p>“Was it not the wind, Miss?” cried Peters, flushing.</p>

<p>“No; I heard wheels going down the drive. And
here is something I found in the hall, Peters—a man’s
glove. Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“It might be Toppen’s, Miss—”</p>

<p>“It might be, but it isn’t,” said Lally, full of suppressed
excitement, that made her strangely beautiful.
“This is a gentleman’s glove. See how soft and fine the kid
is. The color is just the shade of lavender Rufus used to
wear when he wore gloves, and it has just the jessamine
scent he used to drop always into his gloves. And—and
here is one of the very glove buttons he used to slip
from one pair of gloves to another. I would know that<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
small gold knob, with its chased edge, anywhere.
Peters, he has been here! Rufus has been here.”</p>

<p>The flushing, agitated face of Mrs. Peters confessed
the truth.</p>

<p>“He has followed us up from London!” cried Lally,
her eyes glowing like suns. “He has come after me
and traced me to this place. He loves me still—he must
love me, Peters! He must love me better than Miss
Wynde?”</p>

<p>“He said so, Miss Lally.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then it is true? But why did he go away without
seeing me? Why did you not call me? Perhaps he
will give up all for me, thinking me still poor like himself?”</p>

<p>“He said he would, Miss Lally,” said poor, honest
Mrs. Peters, driven to full confession. “He thinks that
I am Miss Wroat, and that you are Mrs. Peters, my poor
companion. And he says he loves you, and wants to
marry you; but he is so unstable and cowardly, and I
knew you ought to make a grand marriage, with your
face and your fortune; and so—and so, Miss Lally, I
sent him off, and he’s gone back to England and to Miss
Wynde.”</p>

<p>Poor Lally stared at her maid with dilating eyes and
horror-stricken countenance. Then she said, in a wailing
voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, Peters, you meant well, I know: but—but you’ve
broken my heart!”</p>

<p>And with a low, wild moan, Lally fell forward in a
dead swoon.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SIR HAROLD’S RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>That night upon which Rufus Black visited Heather
Hills, and was sent away again in despair, was a wild
night throughout Great Britain and upon its coasts.
Ships were wrecked upon the Goodwin Sands, and upon
the south and west coasts. Over the open moors and
heaths of the country the winds went roaring like unloosed
demons, bent upon terrible mischief. Women
with husbands at sea cowered before their blazing fires
that night, and children in their beds snuggled closer
and held their breaths with very fear. Houses were
unroofed in many places, chimneys were blown down,
and lives were lost upon bridges and country roads
through falling timbers and uprooted trees. The gale
that night was one long to be remembered for its wild
violence, one so severe not having been experienced in
Great Britain for years.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins, the Canterbury solicitor, sat in his office
until a late hour that night. His house was in a pleasant,
quiet street, in a good neighborhood, and the lower
floor was occupied by him as his office, the drawing-room
being upon the second floor, and the family rooms above.
The main office had an independent entrance from the
street, with a door opening directly into the office—a
convenient arrangement duly appreciated by Mrs. Atkins,
as it left the house entrance free to her family and guests.</p>

<p>The solicitor had changed somewhat since his first introduction
to the reader. His honest face had grown
thin and sallow, his hair was streaked with gray, and<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
there were anxious lines about his mouth and eyes that
told of unrest and trouble.</p>

<p>He sat in a lounging chair before the fire, his feet on
the fender. His family had long since retired, and the
hour was wearing on toward eleven o’clock. His fire
flamed up in a wild glow, the gas burned brightly, the
red fire gleams lighted the dull office carpet and the
well-polished furniture, making the room seem especially
cozy and delightful. The shutters were lowered, but
no care could shut out the sound of the mad winds
careering through the streets, clutching at resisting outer
blinds, and bearing along now and then some clattering
sign-board or other estray.</p>

<p>“An awful night,” sighed the solicitor. “I have a
strange feeling as if something were going to happen!”</p>

<p>He shifted uneasily in his chair, and bent forward and
laid fresh coals upon the fire. Then he leaned back
again and thought.</p>

<p>The office clock struck eleven, and the loud clangor
struck upon Mr. Atkins in his nervous mood with singular
unpleasantness. Before the echo of the last stroke
had died out, footsteps were heard in the street, unsteady
and wavering, as if the pedestrian were battling
with the storm, and found it difficult to advance against
it.</p>

<p>“Some poor fellow,” thought Mr. Atkins. “He must
be homeless, to be out at this hour and in such a gale.”</p>

<p>The steps came nearer still and nearer, their sound
being now and then lost in the tumult of the winds.
They paused at the foot of the solicitor’s office steps,
and then slowly mounted to the door.</p>

<p>“Who can it be at this time of night?” muttered Mr.
Atkins. “Some vagabond who means to sleep on my
steps? Or is it some houseless wanderer who sees my
light through the shutters, and is come to beg of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>It almost seemed as if it were the latter, for the office
lights did gleam out into the black streets, and lighted
up a patch of pavement.</p>

<p>A knock, low and unsteady, was rung upon the
knocker.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins hesitated. He was not a timid man, but
he had no client who found it necessary to visit him at
that hour, and his visitor, he thought, was as likely to
be some desperate vagrant or professional thief as an
honest man.</p>

<p>The knock, low and faint and imploring, sounded
again. It seemed to the solicitor as if there was something
especially guarded and secret in the manner of it.</p>

<p>He arose and took from his office desk a loaded pistol,
and placed it in his breast pocket. Then he went to the
door and undid the bars and bolts, throwing it half way
open, and peering out.</p>

<p>A man stood upon the steps, muffled in a thick long
overcoat, whose fur collar was turned up above his ears.
A slouched hat was drawn over his face, and Mr. Atkins
could not distinguish a feature of his face.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked the solicitor, his hand feeling for
his pistol.</p>

<p>“An old friend,” was the reply, in a hoarse whisper.
“I must see you. Let me in, Atkins.”</p>

<p>He stepped forward, with an air of command that
impressed Atkins, who involuntarily stepped aside, giving
the stranger admittance.</p>

<p>The new-comer quietly turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>Atkins clutched his pistol, quietly upon his guard.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded. “What do you
want?”</p>

<p>The stranger took off his hat, revealing the upper
portion of a noble head, crowned with grizzled hair.
Then slowly he turned down his greatcoat collar, and<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
stood before Atkins without disguise, displaying a
grandly noble face, with keen blue eyes, a pale bronzed
countenance, and sternly set lips above a gray military
beard.</p>

<p>Atkins’ hand dropped to his side. With a wild and
stifled shriek, he staggered to a chair, his eyes glaring
wildly at the stranger.</p>

<p>“My God!” he cried, with white lips. “Sir Harold
Wynde!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold—for it was indeed he, returned that day to
England, after a prolonged journey from India—smiled
his old warm smile, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold Wynde!” repeated Atkins, not taking
the hand—“who—who died—”</p>

<p>“I can give you the best of proofs, Atkins, that I did
not die in India,” said the baronet, with a cheery little
laugh. “You look at me as at a ghost, but I’m no ghost.
Feel my hand. Is not that real flesh and blood? Atkins,
you are giving me a sorry welcome, my old friend.”</p>

<p>Atkins still stared with a wild incredulity at his old
friend and employer. He could not yet comprehend the
glad truth.</p>

<p>“I—I must be dreaming,” he muttered. “I felt queer
to-night. I—”</p>

<p>Sir Harold advanced and, pulling off his glove, laid
his hand on that of Atkins. Its touch was chill, but unmistakably
human.</p>

<p>“What!” cried the baronet. “Do you believe in
ghosts, my friend? I wouldn’t have believed a bona-fide
wraith could have so startled the hard-headed Atkins
I once knew. I was not eaten by the tiger, Atkins,
but I have been kept a prisoner in the hands of human
tigers until I managed to escape last month. You know
me now, and that I am no ghost?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>Atkins rose up, pale and trembling still, but with an
unutterable joy on his face.</p>

<p>“It is Sir Harold alive, and in the flesh!” he ejaculated.
“Sir Harold whom we mourned as dead! This
is a miracle!”</p>

<p>He clasped the baronet’s hand, and laughed and cried
in a breath. He seemed overflowing with his great joy.</p>

<p>The baronet held the trembling hand of his friend in
a strong, restful pressure for some minutes, during
which not a word was spoken between them. Their
hearts were full.</p>

<p>“I am not myself to-night, Sir Harold,” said Atkins
brokenly, after a little. “I have been upset lately.”</p>

<p>He drew Sir Harold toward the fire, helped him off
with his greatcoat, and ensconced him in the lounging
chair before the fender. Then he drew a chair close beside
the baronet’s, and asked tremulously:</p>

<p>“Have you been to Hawkhurst yet, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. You could not think I would leave
home again so soon, if I had gone there? I only landed
in England to-day, coming through France. I am a
week overdue. I arrived in Canterbury an hour ago,
and as soon as I had food I came to you. I saw your
light through the shutters, but if I had not seen it I
should have rapped you up, in my impatience. I want
you to go with me to Hawkhurst, and to break the news
that I still live to my wife and daughter. My appearance
shocked you nearly into an apoplexy. I must not
appear unannounced to them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins trembled, and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>“You would go to-night—in this storm?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. What is the storm to me? A few miles
only divide me from my home and loved ones. And I
shall see them before I sleep. Oh, Atkins, how I have<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
looked forward to this hour of my home coming: I
have thought of it during the days and nights when I
lay chained in an Indian hut among the Himalayas; I
have thought of it when pacing the lonely deck at midnight
under the stars. I have prayed for this hour as
the crowning joy of my life. Almost home! It seems
as if my soul would burst with rapture. My home! My
wife! My child! The sweetest, holiest words in our
language!”</p>

<p>The baronet’s face glowed with a joyous radiance.
Atkins was sick at heart.</p>

<p>“I have been careful that no hint of my return as from
the dead should arrive before me,” continued Sir Harold.
“I came home under the name of Harold Hunlow. Only
Major Archer and his family, besides yourself, know that
I still live. At the hotel I registered the name of Hunlow,
and no one but a new waiter I had never seen before
saw my face. The surprise of my family will be
complete. Come, Atkins, let us be off. I have a cab
waiting at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“I—I wouldn’t go to-night, Sir Harold,” said Atkins
feebly.</p>

<p>Something in his tones alarmed the baronet.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he demanded. “I—I have taken it for
granted that they are all well at home. Octavia—Neva—how
are they? Speak!”</p>

<p>Atkins arose, twisting his hands nervously together.
His pallor frightened Sir Harold, who arose also.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he whispered. “They—they are not
dead?”</p>

<p>“No, Sir Harold—no!”</p>

<p>“Thank God! You frightened me, Atkins. I can
bear anything, now that I know they are alive. What
has happened? They have not met with an accident?<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
Don’t tell me, Atkins, that my wife, my beautiful young
wife, is insane through grief at my supposed death?”</p>

<p>Atkins groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, grating his teeth and clenching his
hands. “It is not that.”</p>

<p>“What is it then? Speak, for God’s sake. The suspense
is killing me!”</p>

<p>“I have bad news for you, Sir Harold,” said the
solicitor tremblingly. “Let me give you a glass of
wine—”</p>

<p>Sir Harold clutched the solicitor’s arm, his burning eyes
fixed upon the solicitor’s face.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I will, if you will sit down.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold dropped silently into his chair.</p>

<p>“Lady Wynde,” said Atkins—“Lady Wynde—how can
I speak the words to you who love her so, Sir Harold—She
has married again!”</p>

<p>Every vestige of color died from the baronet’s face,
and he lay back upon his chair fainting. Atkins rang for
water and brandy. He bathed Sir Harold’s face and
chafed his hands, and poured brandy down his throat,
the tears on his own cheeks. Presently Sir Harold gasped
for breath, and looked up at him with a dazed and
stunned expression.</p>

<p>“Say that over again, Atkins,” he said feebly. “I don’t
quite understand.”</p>

<p>“I said, Sir Harold,” said the solicitor, every word
giving him a pang, “that Lady Wynde had married
again.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold gave a strange cry, and covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t take it so, Sir Harold,” cried Atkins. “You’ve
had a happy escape from her. She’s a heartless, unprincipled—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>Sir Harold put up his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” he said pleadingly. “You hurt me, Atkins.
She thought me dead, my poor Octavia. Who—who
did she marry!”</p>

<p>“A gamester and adventurer named Craven Black.
During the past month, Sir Harold, I have devoted
much time to the study of Mrs. Craven Black’s antecedents.
Forgive me, Sir Harold, but in this hour you
must know all the truth. I am like the physician who
cuts deeply to extract a ball. Sir Harold, the woman
you married was never fit to be taken into your family;
she was never fit to be placed as step-mother and guardian
over a pure young girl—”</p>

<p>“Atkins, she is my wife. Mine still, although another
claims her. I will not hear a word against her.”</p>

<p>“You must hear it, Sir Harold,” said Atkins resolutely.
“If you do not hear it from me, others less kind
will pour it into your ears. You cannot escape the
knowledge. As I said, during the past month I have
studied up Lady Wynde’s antecedents. I have seen
Mrs. Hyde, Lady Wynde’s aunt, and I have also seen a
former maid of her ladyship. I tell you, Sir Harold,
and I pray you to forgive me for telling you the truth,
the woman you married never loved you. She married
you only as a part of a daring conspiracy—”</p>

<p>“Atkins!”</p>

<p>“It is true, so help me God!” cried Atkins solemnly.
“Lady Wynde—I suppose she is Lady Wynde still, her
last marriage being rendered invalid by your return to
the living, as one might say—Lady Wynde was engaged
to marry Craven Black before she ever saw you. Mrs.
Hyde told me this herself.”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe it!”</p>

<p>“Craven Black was poor, and so was Octavia Hathaway.
You were at Brighton, rich, a widower. Craven<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
Black conceived the idea that Octavia should win and
wed you, and secure a rich jointure, upon which, in
due time, having rid themselves of you, they should
marry—”</p>

<p>“This is monstrous! Atkins, you are deceived. You
are belying a noble woman!”</p>

<p>“Hear the rest, Sir Harold. As God is my judge, I
believe your wife married you intending to poison you!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold shook his head. The idea seemed too
monstrous for belief.</p>

<p>“That affair in the water at Brighton was planned
beforehand,” persisted Atkins. “You rescued the lady,
as was expected of you. She followed up the acquaintance,
and married you. You went to India; and I believe,
if you had not gone, you would have died here
suddenly of poison. When Lady Wynde had worn
mourning a year in most decorous fashion, Craven
Black and his son came up to Wyndham, and early in
September there were great festivities at Hawkhurst, at
the third marriage of Lady Wynde. There was a ball
at the great house, and a ball for the tenantry on the
lawn, with music and fire-works. It was for all the
world an affair such as might have greeted the coming
of age of an heir to a grand property, rather than the
marriage of a widow from the house of her late husband
to a notorious adventurer.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold groaned heavily.</p>

<p>“And they are at Hawkhurst now?” he said, in a
voice so altered that Atkins hardly recognized it.</p>

<p>“No; they have been away for a month.”</p>

<p>“You understand that all these charges are not
proved against Lady Wynde?” said Sir Harold. “I
shall take my wife back again, Atkins, if she will come,
and I will stand between her and the censure of a gossipping
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>“Did you write from India the night before you disappeared,
enjoining your daughter by her love for you
to marry the son of Craven Black?” demanded Atkins
abruptly.</p>

<p>“No; how should I? I don’t know Craven Black, nor
his son.”</p>

<p>Atkins went to his desk, and took out a letter.</p>

<p>“Read that, Sir Harold,” he said, returning and presenting
it to the baronet. “Lady Wynde gave that letter
to Miss Wynde, telling her that it was your last letter
to your daughter, written upon the eve of your supposed
death.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold read the letter to the very end, an awful
sternness gathering on his countenance. The tender
epithets by which he had called his daughter, his particular
modes of speech, and his own phraseology, in
that skillfully forged letter staggered him.</p>

<p>“I never wrote it,” he said briefly. “It is a forgery!”</p>

<p>“Of course. I knew that. But Lady Wynde gave it
to Miss Neva, declaring it to be your last letter.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Rufus Black?”</p>

<p>“A weak-souled, kindly young fellow, the son of a
villain, and a ready instrument in the hands of his father.
He loves Miss Neva, and proposed to her. She, however,
loves Lord Towyn—”</p>

<p>“Lord Towyn! My old college-mate?”</p>

<p>“No; his son. Arthur has come into the title and
property, and is as noble a young man as any in England.
Miss Neva favored him, and the result is, Lady
Wynde and Craven Black conceived a hatred of your
daughter, and determined to bend her to their will. Sir
Harold, as God hears me, Lady Wynde is a wicked, unscrupulous
woman.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s face was deathly white. The letter,
still held in his trembling hands, was proof of his wife’s<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
wickedness, and he began to be convinced that he had
been cruelly deceived by an unprincipled woman.</p>

<p>“It would have been better if I had died in India!”
he moaned.</p>

<p>“Not so. Sir Harold, there is more to hear. Can
you bear another blow?”</p>

<p>Sir Harold bowed; he was too broken to speak.</p>

<p>“A month ago, Lady Wynde, with her new husband
and Miss Wynde, went away, ostensibly to Wynde
Heights. But they did not go there. A letter came
from Brussels to Lord Towyn, purporting to be from
Miss Wynde, but Lord Towyn went to Brussels, and
discovered that the young lady and her enemies have
not been there. We have had detectives at work for
weeks; Lord Towyn is at work day and night scarcely
knowing rest, and I have done all that I could, but the
fact remains. Craven Black and his wife have abducted
Miss Wynde, and God alone, besides her enemies, knows
where she is.”</p>

<p>The baronet leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Neva missing!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Harold, missing for a month past, and she
is in the hands of enemies who would not scruple to
take her life, if they could hope to make money by her
death. We have searched Great Britain for her, and
have detectives at this moment upon the Continent. She
is gone—lost! Her enemies have determined to force
her into a marriage with Rufus Black, and to seize
upon her property. She is helpless in their hands. You
have returned in time to help search for her, but I am
hopeless. We shall never find her except she is dead, or
married to the son of that villain!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold was about to speak, but his voice choked.
He leaned against his chair, looking like one dying.</p>

<p>And at this juncture, while the wind tore yet more<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
madly through the streets, footsteps were heard ascending
to the street door of the office, and, for the second
time that night, the office knocker sounded lowly,
secretly, and cautiously, yet with an imperiousness that
commanded an instant admittance.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ON THE RIGHT TRACK AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The conclusion of the low and cautious knocking
upon the office door of Mr. Atkins was lost in a wild
burst of the gale which tore along the streets, shrieking
and moaning like some maddened demon. Sir Harold
Wynde and Mr. Atkins looked at each other, and then
both glanced at the clock. It was upon the stroke of
twelve.</p>

<p>“A late hour for a call,” said the baronet uneasily.
“I have no wish to be seen, Atkins. I am in no mood
to encounter a possible client of yours.”</p>

<p>The knock sounded again, in a lull of the storm, low,
secret and imperative.</p>

<p>Atkins’ face brightened up with sudden relief and joy.</p>

<p>“I know that knock,” he said. “Please step into the
inner office, Sir Harold. You shall see no one but friends
to-night.”</p>

<p>He opened the door of the small, dark, inner office,
and Sir Harold passed in and stood in the darkness,
leaving the door slightly ajar.</p>

<p>Atkins hastened to open the outer door. A gust of
wind swept fiercely in, and with it, and as if impelled<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
by it, a man hurried into the office, and closed the door
with both his hands.</p>

<p>He was slender, but so muffled in coat collar and cap
that no one could have guessed his identity.</p>

<p>“Lord Towyn?” said Atkins doubtfully.</p>

<p>The new-comer took off his cap and turned down his
collar. The lawyer’s instinct had not deceived him.
The noble face, the bright blue eyes, so full of warmth
and glow, the tawny mustache, and the golden hair
above a grand forehead—all these, now displayed to the
solicitor’s gaze, were the features of Neva’s favored
lover. But the young earl looked pale and worn by
anxieties, and although now there was a glow and brightness
and eagerness in his face and manner, yet one
could see in all his features the traces of great and
recent suffering.</p>

<p>“Alone, Atkins?” he exclaimed, extending his hand,
while he swept a quick glance about the room. “I am
glad to have found you up, but had you gone to sleep,
I must have awakened you. I have just received important
news by messenger, who routed me up at my hotel.
I came to you as soon as I could—”</p>

<p>“If the news is unpleasant, do not tell it just yet,”
said Atkins nervously, with a glance at the inner room.
“I have news too, Lord Towyn. Come to the fire. Bless
us, how the wind howls!”</p>

<p>The young earl removed his greatcoat and advanced to
the fire, and Atkins went into the inner office. The
sound of whispering followed. Lord Towyn heard the
sound and started, and at the same moment his glance
fell upon Sir Harold Wynde’s cast-off greatcoat and hat.
Presently Atkins returned, rubbing his hands together
with excitement.</p>

<p>“You are not alone, I see,” said the young earl. “I
will see you again, Atkins—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“Stay, my lord,” said the solicitor. “I have news,
great news, to impart to you. Let me communicate
mine first. Can you bear a great surprise—a shock?”</p>

<p>“You have heard from Miss Wynde?” cried Lord
Towyn. “You have later news even than mine? Speak,
Atkins. Those villains have not succeeded in forcing
her into a marriage with young Black? It is not that—say
that it is not.”</p>

<p>“It is not that, my lord. How am I to tell you the
startling news I have just learned? My lord, I have
had a visit to-night from a gentleman who has just returned
from India. He knew Sir Harold Wynde well,
and came to give me all the particulars of Sir Harold’s
supposed death!”</p>

<p>“<em>Supposed</em> death? How strangely you choose your
words, Atkins. <em>Supposed</em> death?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” cried Atkins, trembling and eager.
“We have all mourned Sir Harold as dead. And this
gentleman says—prepare for a surprise, my lord—he
says that Sir Harold Wynde still lives!”</p>

<p>The young earl started, and grew white.</p>

<p>“It is impossible!” he ejaculated. “He lives? It is
preposterous! Atkins, you are the sport of some impostor!”</p>

<p>“No, no, my lord. I believe it; I believe that Sir
Harold lives!”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten the letter of Surgeon Graham,
giving a circumstantial and minute account of Sir Harold’s
death?” demanded Lord Towyn. “If Sir Harold
had survived his encounter with the tiger, would he not
have returned home over a year ago?”</p>

<p>“The—the gentleman who gave me the particulars
of Sir Harold’s fate,” said Atkins, full of suppressed
excitement, “says that the baronet was unfortunate
enough to incur the enmity of his Hindoo servant, who<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
secretly swore revenge. Sir Harold actually encountered
the tiger, as was said, but a shot from the servant
frightened the beast, and he fled back into the jungle.
Sir Harold was wounded and bleeding and his horse
was killed. The Hindoo servant picked up his disabled
master, and, instead of taking him back to Major
Archer’s bungalow, he carried him forward and gave
him into the hands of some of his own friends and
country people, and these friends of the Hindoo carried
off Sir Harold further into the hill country, to their
home, a sort of mountain fastness. They kept him there
closely imprisoned, and while we mourned our friend as
dead, he was chained in a cell but little better than a
dungeon.”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn still looked incredulous.</p>

<p>“How did the bearer of this strange tale discover
these strange facts, if facts they are?” he demanded.
“I should like to see this gentleman from India? I
should like to question him—”</p>

<p>He paused, as the door of the inner room opened, and
Sir Harold Wynde, pale and haggard, came into the
outer office.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn uttered a strange cry, and sprang backward,
his face whitening to deathliness.</p>

<p>Sir Harold approached the young man, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>“Behold ‘the gentleman from India,’” he said, faintly
smiling. “My dear boy, ask me as many questions as
you like. Don’t you know me, Arthur, that you stare at
me so? I am no ghost, although our friend Atkins took
me for one.”</p>

<p>Another cry, but this time a cry of rapture, broke
from the young earl’s lips. He bounded forward and
clasped Sir Harold’s hands in his, and both were silent
with an emotion too mighty for speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>Atkins turned aside to add fresh fuel to the blazing
fire, his own features working.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold! O, Sir Harold!” cried Lord Towyn at
last, in a very ecstasy of gladness. “What a joy this
will be to my poor little Neva! She has mourned for
you as dead, and I have thought that the shadow of
your supposed fate would darken all her life. How
glad she will be, my poor little girl!”</p>

<p>“Your little girl?” said Sir Harold.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn’s fair face flushed.</p>

<p>“I love Neva, and she loves me,” he said frankly.
“She has promised to marry me, and I hope, Sir Harold,
that you retain your former good opinion of me, and
will sanction our union.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” said the baronet, pressing the young
earl’s hand warmly. “It has always been my desire, as
it was that of your father, to unite my family to yours.
Your face tells me that you have fulfilled the glorious
promise of your boyhood. If Neva consents to marry
you, my dear Arthur, I shall not refuse my consent.”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn looked his delight, and then cast a quick,
inquiring glance at Atkins.</p>

<p>“Does Sir Harold know?” he asked significantly.</p>

<p>“I have told him,” answered the solicitor, “that Miss
Wynde has disappeared in the most mysterious manner
and that she is in the power of a couple of adventurers—”</p>

<p>Sir Harold interrupted Atkins by a passionate gesture.</p>

<p>“Arthur,” exclaimed the baronet, his proud face drawn
with pain. “Atkins tells me that I have been deceived in—in
Lady Wynde, and that he has discovered her to be
an adventuress, unscrupulous and unprincipled. Is this
his prejudice? I cannot give utter credence to it.”</p>

<p>“It is God’s truth, Sir Harold,” said Lord Towyn solemnly,
holding the baronet’s hand in a strong, firm<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
pressure. “It is better that you should know the truth
from us than to hear it from strangers, or be further
deceived by the woman you made your wife. Lady
Wynde is an adventuress, bold and false and wicked.”</p>

<p>“You forget that I knew her history even back to her
childhood,” cried Sir Harold eagerly. “I did not marry
her with my eyes blindfolded. She never attempted to
impose herself upon me as other than she was. She
made known her whole life to me. She was the daughter
of a naval officer, and the niece of Mrs. Hyde, a lady of
good family and position, who lives a very retired life
in Bloomsbury Square, London. We ate our wedding
breakfast in Mrs. Hyde’s house. Lady Wynde’s first
husband was the Honorable Charles Hathaway, the
younger son of a Viscount. Lady Wynde’s family connections
both by birth and marriage are excellent. I
knew all this beyond a peradventure before I married
her. And yet you call her an adventuress!”</p>

<p>“And so she was, Sir Harold,” exclaimed Atkins.
“Her past life, her family and her connections were all
you say. Her record was all fair. Not a word had ever
been whispered against her reputation, and she went in
the best society, and had admirers and suitors. All this
I grant. But she was none the less an adventuress at
heart. She had an income of three hundred pounds a
year and spent a thousand, sponged from relatives, or
given her by Craven Black, from his winnings at the
gaming table or at the races. She was engaged to marry
Craven Black soon after Mr. Hathaway’s death, and before
her marriage with you. Mrs. Hyde is not overfond
of her niece, and told me this fact herself. This marriage,
owing to the meagre fixed income of the pair, was
deferred, and finally they conceived the idea that Mrs.
Hathaway should contract a wealthy marriage, secure a
comfortable jointure, become a widow, and then marry<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
Craven Black. There can be no doubt that your marriage
with Mrs. Hathaway was the result of a conspiracy
against you by these two villains, male and female—that
they had set a trap for you, Sir Harold, and that you fell
into it!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold turned his haggard eyes upon Lord
Towyn.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said the young earl, full of the tenderest
sympathy. “You were imposed upon, Sir Harold. The
woman you married, so fair and spotless in seeming,
was like some fair fruit with a worm at its core. There
are adventuresses in good society, of good birth and
spotless reputations, as there are well-born adventurers.
Mr. Atkins is right. Craven Black and Mrs. Hathaway
have played a daring game, but they have not yet won.
This is a terrible stroke to you, dear Sir Harold; but
bear it bravely. You are not desolate because Lady
Wynde feigned a love for you, and has proved false and
wicked. You have the holy memories of your first wife
to keep pure and steadfast your faith in woman. You
have Neva to love you. You have your friends.”</p>

<p>But Sir Harold threw up his arms with a gesture of
despair.</p>

<p>“I loved <em>her</em>!” he said brokenly. “I have thought of
her in my Indian dungeon, and on the lonely sea, and
have planned how to break to her the news of my return
tenderly and gently, that her reason might be spared a
shock which I feared might destroy it. And, O God!
all the while she never loved me! While I thought of
her upon the deck, with longings for wings, that I might
sooner reach her, she was the wife of another, and exulted
in the thought that she was rid of me forever! Ah,
this is a dreary coming home!”</p>

<p>“It is, Sir Harold,” said Lord Towyn sorrowfully;
“but the wickedness of one person whom you have<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
loved need not darken your life, nor paralyze your energies.
Neva is in peril. Rouse yourself from this great
grief for her sake. Think what joy your return will be to
her. We must find her, and save her.”</p>

<p>The young earl had touched the right chord. Sir
Harold aroused himself from his despair, and said:</p>

<p>“Yes; we must find her, and save her. But where
are we to look for her? If the detectives have failed to
find a clue to her whereabouts, how are we to succeed?”</p>

<p>“I have been upon the Continent,” said Lord Towyn,
“and have traveled from one end of England to the
other. I have been upon a score of false trails, and
failed to find a trace of those I sought. I have now been
three or four days in this town, consulting every day
with Atkins or Sir John Freise, while the detectives continued
the search. And to-night I have received news
which for the first time gives me hope that we are nearing
the end. A messenger, sent by one of my detectives,
came to me by the last down train from London, with a
report of discoveries.”</p>

<p>“They have been found?” cried Sir Harold eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not yet. The object of Craven Black and his wife—I
hardly know how to call her, Sir Harold—was to marry
Neva to Black’s son, and so obtain control over the Hawkhurst
property,” said Lord Towyn. “It is to effect this
marriage that Craven Black and his wife are engaged in
persecuting Neva. When they left Hawkhurst, they left
Rufus Black behind them. It occurred to me that when
they should deem matters in a fair state of progress, or
when Neva showed signs of relenting, they would send
for Rufus to come and plead his cause, or to marry her,
wherever they might be. I therefore hired a detective to
watch Rufus, and it is from this detective, and not from
those in search of Neva, that I have to-night heard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“And what does he say?” demanded Atkins breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Young Black has remained at Hawkhurst ever since
the marriage—some five weeks. Two or three days ago
he went up to London. The detective, who had been
stopping at Wyndham as a commercial traveler in
broken health, went up on the same train. It seemed at
first, my messenger says, as if young Black had had no
object beyond a day’s saunter in town. He visited picture
shops and so on, but that night he went to the
Great Northern railway station, and found the train
gone. That movement of his, as the detective said, began
to look like business. Black went to his hotel, the detective
still on his track. The next morning young
Black sold his watch and chain, and the next evening he
was off again to the Great Northern railway station.
He caught the night express, and went on it, the detective
on the same train. The detective sent a note from
Edinburgh to a fellow-officer, who brought it to me to-night.
I am convinced that Rufus Black has gone to rejoin
his father, and that if we follow him we shall find
Neva.”</p>

<p>“To what place did he book himself?” asked Atkins.</p>

<p>“To Inverness. It is plain that while the Blacks tried
to persuade us that they were upon the Continent, they
were safely hidden with Neva in the Scottish Highlands.
They may have gone there from some idea of bringing
about an informal Scottish marriage between Neva and
young Black. Neva can know nothing of the marriage
laws of Scotland, where a declaration from a woman
that a certain man is her husband, when he hears and
does not contradict the assertion, and vice versa, constitutes
a legal and binding marriage. The Blacks may
calculate upon Neva’s ignorance, and hope to avail themselves<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
of the facilities of Scottish law in marrying her to
Rufus.”</p>

<p>“It is very probable,” said Atkins, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“Young Black has the start of us. He must have
arrived at Inverness to-day. I came here to propose,
Atkins, that we start for the north by the earliest morning
train. We are on the right track now,” said Lord
Towyn. “Let us follow it up promptly.”</p>

<p>“We will go in the morning,” declared Atkins.</p>

<p>“I shall go also,” said Sir Harold. “Let the secret
of my return be kept a secret still. I do not wish to
warn this Craven Black, or put him on his guard. Call
me Mr. Hunlow. It is the name I traveled home under.
And be careful not to betray my secret until I myself
declare it.”</p>

<p>The three sat together by the office fire all the remainder
of the night and talked. In the morning Atkins
wrote a note to his wife, and another to his clerks, and
leaving the notes upon his desk, went out with his two
guests before the family were astir. Sir Harold muffled
his face beyond recognition, and conducted Lord Towyn
and Atkins to his hotel. Here they were served with
breakfast, and soon after they proceeded to the station,
and took the train for London.</p>

<p>Sir Harold breathed more freely when they had left
the Cathedral town behind them. He was well known
in Canterbury, and with a strange nervous shrinking,
he dreaded recognition before he should choose to make
his return known.</p>

<p>On arriving in London, the three pursuers hastened
to the Great Northern Railway station, and an hour
later they were on their way to Scotland, upon the trail
of Rufus Black.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">REUNITED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Upon the day after the storm, a high wind still prevailed.
No sailing vessel dared put out to sea from
Inverness. The sky was dun and gray, with now and
then a fitful gleam of sickly yellowish sunlight. The
black waters were all alive with “white caps,” and the
sullen roar of the waves, as they hurled themselves
against the cliffs upon whose summit stood the house of
Heather Hills, filled all the house with its monotonous
tumult.</p>

<p>Lally Bird spent the morning in her own room, upon
a sofa in a recessed window. Mrs. Peters came and
went softly, bestowing pitying glances upon the round
gipsy face lying so white and sorrowful against the
cushions, but the dusky eyes were looking seaward with
a strange, far off, steadfast gaze, and it was evident that
the young girl was not even conscious of the presence
of her attendant.</p>

<p>At noon Mrs. Peters brought up a tray on which was
spread a tempting luncheon of chocolate, hot rolls, delicate
game birds, and jellies. She placed the tray upon
a low table, and wheeled it beside the sofa. Still Lally
did not stir.</p>

<p>“Miss Lally,” cried the good woman, her lips quivering.
“Are you not going to eat to-day? You had no
breakfast. You will be ill. I know that I have offended
you beyond all forgiveness, and that my face must be
unpleasant in your sight, but I would undo what I have
done if I could. Better almost any kind of a marriage<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
than to see you lying here looking so wan and hopeless.
Oh, Miss Lally, if you would only speak to me!”</p>

<p>Lally turned her face slowly, with a look of surprise
mingling with her expression of pain.</p>

<p>“Why, Peters,” she said kindly, “I did not know you
were so troubled about me. I am not angry at you.
You meant what you did for the best. There, don’t cry,
Peters. I am not angry; indeed, I am not. You are as
much my friend as ever. Sit down by me, and we will
eat our luncheon together.”</p>

<p>Peters complied as soon as she could command her
emotion, and Lally aroused herself to speak cheerfully,
and to inquire concerning the results of the storm.</p>

<p>After the luncheon the young mistress of Heather
Hills announced her intention of going out for a solitary
walk. The wind was not so high as it had been in the
morning, and Mrs. Peters did not venture any objections.
Lally attired herself in a bombazine walking
dress and astrachan jacket, hat and muff, and about two
o’clock she went out alone for a walk along the cliffs.</p>

<p>For an hour or more she rambled on, stopping now
and then to rest, and keeping near the sea, over whose
wide wild waters her gaze strayed and fixed itself with
singular steadfastness. At last she sat down upon a
great bowlder, and the slender black figure was outlined
against the gray sky with startling distinctness.</p>

<p>Before her lay the wild and restless sea, behind her
the undulating fields of her new domain. At one side
of her, in the gray distance, was the house of Heather
Hills, and on the other hand, and nearer, was the low
range of heath-clad hills which gave the estate its name.</p>

<p>It was a lonely spot, that upon which she had paused
to rest, with a bold bluff surmounted by a very chaos
of rocks, upon whose summit she had perched herself. A
few sea-gulls were screaming in the air, but besides them<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
and the wild birds on the heath there was no sign of life
far or near.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The wind still blew strong and fierce,
tugging at her hat and garments with strong, despoiling
hands. Her vail was swept over the bluff into the abyss
of waters, and her hair was torn from its confining
braids, and tumbled over her shoulders in a dusky
cascade. But still Lally sat high up upon the rocky
mass, paying no heed to wind or murmur of wave, her
soul being busy with the great problem of her destiny.</p>

<p>And so, looking seaward with great longing eyes, she
did not see a human figure coming toward her over the
fields. It came nearer and nearer—the figure of Rufus
Black!</p>

<p>The young man had gone back to Inverness upon the
previous night, but he had not been content to accept
his dismissal at the hands of Mrs. Peters. His old love
for Lally was strong and fierce, and he was determined
to win back his lost young wife, if energy and patience
and love and sincere repentance could win her back. So,
after a sleepless night, and a morning spent in indecision
and irresolution, he had come out again to
Heather Hills. Mrs. Peters was in her own room, and
the housemaid had answered his knock. Rufus had inquired
for Miss Bird, but the housemaid had never heard
the name. He then asked for Mrs. Black. That name
was also unknown at Heather Hills. In this dilemma,
believing Lally to be at the Hills, as a companion to
Miss Wroat, and believing her to have taken a new name
as a disguise, he boldly asked for Miss Wroat, determined
to see Lally’s supposed employer, and to entreat
her to intercede in his behalf with Lally. The housemaid
had told him that Miss Wroat had gone out for a walk,
indicating the direction, and calling up all his courage,
Rufus had started in pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>He saw the dark and slender figure perched on the
peaks while yet afar off. Something in its droop reminded
him of Lally, and he came on at a swinging
pace, his eager gaze never swerving from her; and as he
came nearer and yet nearer, the conviction stole upon
him that it was Lally at whom he looked.</p>

<p>“She must have come out with Miss Wroat,” he
thought. “Rich ladies never walk without an attendant.
She has dropped behind, being tired. It is Lally!
it is—it is!”</p>

<p>He came up swiftly, the damp soil deadening the
sound of his footsteps. He gained the rocks, and began
to climb them to Lally’s side, but the girl did not stir,
nor notice his approach.</p>

<p>A sudden sound at her side at last startled her. With
a quick exclamation, she turned her head—and beheld
him!</p>

<p>She did not speak, but her great black eyes grew
larger, and her face grew suddenly so deathly white that
he thought she must be fainting.</p>

<p>“Lally! O Lally!” he cried to her, in an anguished,
broken voice. “Thank God! I have found you! Oh,
my darling, my little wife, whom I have mourned as
dead!”</p>

<p>He knelt down before her, in the shadow of a projecting
rock, the tears streaming over his face, and his eyes
regarding her in wild imploring. So a devotee might
have knelt to his patron saint, feeling unworthy to approach
her, but longing and praying with his whole soul
for forgiveness and mercy.</p>

<p>Lally felt her soul melt within her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rufus!” she gasped, in a choking whisper.</p>

<p>He put up his arms to enfold her. She shrank back,
not with loathing, but with a sudden dignity, a sort of
majesty, that awed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“You must not touch me, Rufus,” she commanded.
“I am not your wife—”</p>

<p>“You are! You are! Before God, I declare that you
are my wife—”</p>

<p>“Hush, Rufus! You wrote to me that I was not your
wife. Don’t you remember? You said that our marriage
was ‘null and void.’”</p>

<p>“I thought it was. My father told me so!” cried
Rufus. “O Lally, I have been a poor, weak-souled
wretch. I am not worthy of your love. I should have
stood by you, instead of basely deserting you through
my own personal cowardice. My father threatened to
have me indicted for perjury, in swearing that we were
of age at the time of our marriage, and I—I was afraid.
You can never respect me, Lally, nor love me again, I
know, but if you knew how I have suffered you would
pity me.”</p>

<p>“I have always pitied you,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“I thought you dead. I saw your poor mutilated
drowned body in my dreams. Day and night it haunted
me. I was nearly beside myself. I thought I should go
mad. My father’s mind was set upon my marriage with
a great Kentish heiress who loved another than me. I
appealed to her to save me—to save me from my anguish,
torture and remorse, produced by continual
thoughts of you! I had no heart to give her. I was
base and unmanly in offering her the dregs of the cup
that had been filled for you; but oh, Lally, I was half
mad and wholly despairing! I wanted the love of some
good woman to interpose and save me from going to
perdition.”</p>

<p>“I heard your offer of marriage to her,” said Lally.
“And you are engaged to marry her?”</p>

<p>“No; she refused me. I am free, Lally, and I thank
God for it. What should I have done if I had married her<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
and then discovered that you still live? I love you and
you alone in the whole world. I am of age and my own
master. I have thrown off the shackles my father has
kept upon me. I mean to be brave and honest and true
henceforward, so help me God! I mean to be a man,
Lally, in the best and noblest sense of the word. It
shall never be said again of me that I am ‘unstable as
water,’ or that I am a coward. Lally, I offer you a
second marriage, which no one can contest. Will you
forgive me, and take me back?”</p>

<p>His words found echo in Lally’s heart, but she did not
speak. Her pallor gave place to a sudden rose stain, and
she began to tremble.</p>

<p>“I came to-day to entreat Miss Wroat to intercede
with you for me,” said Rufus, becoming alarmed at her
silence. “I have not a fine home to offer you, such as
Miss Wroat gives you, but I will work for you, Lally. I
will make myself a great painter for your sake. Those
worthless daubs I painted at New Brompton belong to
the past life. Henceforward I will paint better pictures,
and show that there is something in me. We will have
two cosy rooms somewhere in the London suburbs, and
you shall have a sunny window for flowers, and I will
work for you, and you shall never know want or misery
again. I can do anything with and for you, Lally, but
if left to stand by myself I shall surely fall. Lally, little
wife, take me back!”</p>

<p>He crept up nearer to her and held out his arms.</p>

<p>She crept in to them like a weary child.</p>

<p>She might justly have reproached him for his weakness
and cowardice, and have taunted him with having
courted the heiress of Hawkhurst, but she did neither.
She nestled in his arms, and looked up at him with
great tender eyes full of a sweet compassion and love
and offered him her lips to kiss!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>And so they were reunited.</p>

<p>For a while they sat in silence, their hearts too full for
words. Then Rufus Black reverently touched her black
garments, and asked simply:</p>

<p>“Are these worn for me?”</p>

<p>Lally shook her head.</p>

<p>“For the lost love and vanished trust?” he asked.
“Yes, I see. But, my wife, if you will love and trust
me again, I will try to make your life all rose color.
Poor little wife! How you have suffered! I know the
whole story from Miss Wroat. When I called at the
house yonder last evening and asked for you as Mrs.
Peters, a tall bony woman who stood in the hall came
forward and said she was Mrs. Peters. I was completely
mystified, for I had decided in my own mind that you
were known here as Mrs. Peters, but I now see how it is.
The old lady knows your story and was angry at me,
and called herself Mrs. Peters to throw me off your track.
She told me all your adventures since we parted. And
now, little wife, let us seek your employer and tell her
that you have taken me back, and that we are to be
married to-morrow morning at Inverness.”</p>

<p>“So soon, Rufus?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I mean to make you mine in a new bond that
no one can contest. I have never taken steps to have
our first marriage set aside, and I think it still stands.
But we will be married quietly to-morrow morning in a
Presbyterian church, and we can be so married without
a license or publication of bans. May I take you to
church to-morrow, little wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lally, softly. “Oh, Rufus, I do think you
are going to be strong and brave and true henceforward,
and if so I shall not regret what I have suffered. It has
been very bitter,” and she shuddered; “but God is good<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
to us at the last. I will try and be a good wife, and to
strengthen and uphold you.”</p>

<p>“You were always a good wife to me,” sobbed Rufus,
with a sudden remembrance of her gentleness, her tenderness,
her strong faith in him, and her resolute faith
that he would some day achieve honors and wealth.
“Oh, Lally, I am not worthy to touch the hem of your
garments, but for your sake I will be a man.”</p>

<p>Lally stroked his cheek softly, as she had been wont
to do in the long-ago, at the dingy lodgings at New
Brompton.</p>

<p>“My poor boy!” she whispered yearningly. “My
poor dear boy!”</p>

<p>“Shall we go now in search of Miss Wroat?” asked
Rufus, drying his eyes. “I do not see her on the shore.
I own I am afraid to meet her, Lally. It’s a remnant of
the old cowardice, you see. But last night, when she
told me your pitiful story, I quailed before her. She
must despise me, and she will surely try to persuade you
to cast me off.”</p>

<p>“My poor Rufus!” said Lally, with a gay, sweet
smile, such as had not visited her roguish mouth since
the blight had fallen on her life. “Mrs. Peters is harsh
in seeming, but her heart is true and tender. She loves
me dearly, and I love her more as a friend than as a
mistress. One thing we must understand, Rufus,” and
Lally’s gayety increased, “I can’t part with dear old
Peters.”</p>

<p>Rufus looked aghast.</p>

<p>“You—you won’t marry me then?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rufus; but I must keep Peters. She won’t
leave me; and besides, it was only yesterday I thought
her the only friend I had in the world.”</p>

<p>“Her name <em>is</em> Peters then?” said Rufus, bewildered.
“I traced you two up from London under the names of<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
Miss Wroat and Mrs. Peters. I didn’t notice a third
name as belonging to the party. By what name are you
known here then, Lally?”</p>

<p>“As Miss Wroat, dear.”</p>

<p>Rufus looked his amazement.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t understand,” he said helplessly. “They
said that Miss Wroat was an eccentric old lady, who
was rich, and odd as Dick’s hatband. Has she adopted
you?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Rufus, that last morning we
spent together at New Brompton?” said Lally gravely.
“I told you then that I had no relative living except a
great-aunt, an old lady who lived in London, and who
was rich, but whose name I did not know. That aunt I
afterward discovered. Her name was Mrs. Wroat. She
was an eccentric old lady, but good and sweet at heart,
and I loved her. She is dead, and it is for her I wear
mourning.”</p>

<p>Rufus looked open-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>“That is not all,” said Lally. “I took my aunt’s name
at her death, at her request. She made me her heiress.
I am the owner of the town house in Mount street, and
of the estate of Heather Hills, and have besides fifty thousand
pounds safely invested, so that I have an income
of about three thousand pounds a year.”</p>

<p>Rufus’ arms dropped from his wife’s waist.</p>

<p>“An heiress!” he muttered. “And I have dared to
dream that you would take me back? An heiress! A
trifle of money will set you free, Lally, from any marriage
claims, and you can marry according to your new
position. I do not wonder that Mrs. Peters turned me
out of your house, a poor, good-for-nothing coward
unfit even to address you. An heiress! O Heaven!
The word is like a two-edged sword between us!”</p>

<p>He moved backward, white and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>A mischievous gleam shot from Lally’s gipsy eyes.</p>

<p>“I have known so much of poverty,” she said, “that
I should like to keep this wealth. It would make a
good basis to build upon. But if it is ‘like a two-edged
sword between us,’ I suppose I can endow some already
rich hospital with it, or give it to Peters, or send it to
the heathen.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean, Lally,” cried Rufus, all agitation,
“that you, a rich lady, will stoop from your high estate
and marry me, and try to make something of me?”</p>

<p>“I do mean just that!” cried Lally, with spirit. “For
you know, Rufus, I—I love you.”</p>

<p>Rufus was at her side again in an instant.</p>

<p>The hour wore on, and the early dusk of the gathering
evening fell around the reunited lovers. Lally
started at last, crying out:</p>

<p>“How dark it grows! It must be five o’clock, and
Mrs. Peters will be distracted about me. I don’t know
as it is just etiquette, Rufus, but the circumstances are
peculiar, and I don’t believe that Mrs. Grundy has laid
down any rule to fit the precise case, and the situation
is so remote, and I don’t believe anybody will know or
care; and so—and so I’ll invite you to remain to dine
with me. But at an early hour—by ten o’clock, mind!—you
must start for Inverness.”</p>

<p>“And you will meet me there at eleven o’clock in the
morning, at the kirk, little wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lally solemnly, and with a holy joy in
her black eyes, “I will be there! Who shall part us
now, Rufus?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN UNTIMELY ARRIVAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the early dawn of a gray wild morning, Sir Harold
Wynde, Lord Towyn, and Mr. Atkins arrived at Inverness.
They proceeded directly to the Railway Hotel,
and secured bedrooms and sitting-room, and ordered
breakfast. Some attention to their toilet was necessary,
and after baths and vigorous brushing, they met in their
sitting-room, and here a very tempting Scottish breakfast
was served to them.</p>

<p>They were still lingering at the table, discussing their
future movements, when a knock was heard at the door,
and the detective who had been set to watch Rufus
Black entered the room.</p>

<p>He was a thin, small man, with a sharp business face,
and looked the very ideal of a keen commercial traveler,
and Sir Harold for the moment supposed that such was
his vocation, and that the man had strayed into the
wrong room. This impression was speedily corrected.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my lord,” said the officer, addressing
himself to the young earl. “Expected your lordship
up yesterday. Good-morning, Mr. Atkins. Fine
morning, sir—for Scotland. My lord, can I see you
alone for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“Say what you have to say here, Ryan,” said the
young earl. “Mr. Atkins is a fellow-guardian of the
young lady of whom we are in search, and this gentleman,
Mr. Hunlow, is also a friend of Miss Wynde.
Speak out, therefore. Have you any news?”</p>

<p>The detective glanced half uneasily at the baronet,
whose striking face announced that he was no common<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
personage. The gray hair and gray military beard had
not greatly changed Sir Harold’s looks, but Ryan had
never seen the baronet before, and of course conceived
no suspicion of his identity.</p>

<p>The baronet arose and went to the hearth, sitting
down before the fire, his face half turned away from the
detective, who again addressed himself to Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>“There is news, my lord,” he announced. “I succeeded
in tracing Rufus Black up to this place. He
stopped at the Caledonian. In fact, he is stopping
there now.”</p>

<p>The young earl’s face kindled with excitement.</p>

<p>“Then we cannot be far from Miss Wynde!” he exclaimed.
“He has stopped two or three days at Inverness,
and that proves that he has not much further to
go. Has he been out of Inverness since he came?”</p>

<p>The detective’s face clouded a little.</p>

<p>“Rufus Black arrived at Inverness the day before yesterday,”
he said. “Upon the afternoon of the very day
on which he arrived, while I was at dinner, he went off
in a cab, and did not return till late in the evening. I
was lounging about the door when he came back, and
he looked the very picture of despair, and came in recklessly
and went to his room.”</p>

<p>“That proves that Miss Wynde is not many miles
from here,” said Lord Towyn. “His despair may be
readily accounted for, if he had just come from an interview
with her.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday,” continued the officer, “he strolled about
the town all the forenoon, and went down to the river,
and visited the wharves on the Canal, and seemed to be
making up his mind to something that required courage.
After luncheon at the Caledonian, he took a cab and
went off again, not returning till midnight last night.”</p>

<p>“And you followed him?” cried Atkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>“What, and put that sharp old ferret Craven Black on
his guard!” ejaculated Ryan, in astonishment. “No,
sir. We’ve got an uncommon pair to deal with. Mr.
Black and his lady are as shrewd and keen as any old
stagers I ever knew. It wouldn’t do to let them suspect
that we are on their track, or they would outwit us
yet, and perhaps put this young lady in peril. People
do a many things when they get desperate that will do
them no good, and is sure to harm them if found out.”</p>

<p>A stifled groan came from Sir Harold. Ryan shot a
quick, suspicious glance at him.</p>

<p>“Then you are at a stand-still, Ryan,” said Mr. Atkins
impatiently. “You have treed the game and sat down
to wait for us?”</p>

<p>“By no means, sir,” answered Ryan deliberately. “I
saw the cabby after Rufus Black had gone to bed, and
arf-a-crown drew out of the fellow all that he knew.
Mind you my lord, that gold and silver make the best
cork-screws in existence. The cabby owned up all he
knew, as I said, and a pity it wasn’t more. He drove
out with his fare to an estate called Heather Hills, between
this and Nairn, on the coast, and a wild, bleak
spot it is, according to cabby. They went up a long
drive and stopped in a carriage porch, and Rufus Black
he knocked and rung, and a house-maid came to the
door, and he asked her something, and she pointed
down the coast. And, telling cabby to wait, young
Black went down the bluffs and struck across the fields.
Cabby put an oil-cloth on his horse, for the wind was
blowing free and strong from the sea, and sat there on
his box, and sat there till it began to grow dark and he
began to swear a blue streak; and then, at last, young
Black came back with a young lady dressed in black
upon his arm, a hanging on to him so very fond, and a<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
looking up at him so very tender, that cabby saw that
they were lovers.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Lord Towyn, turning pale. “I
will stake my very soul on Miss Wynde’s courage, and
her fidelity to me. No personal fears, no cruelty even,
could drive her into accepting Rufus Black. I know her
brave and glorious nature; I know that she could never
know a moment of weakness or yielding. The cabman
has deceived you, Ryan.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” said the detective doggedly. “I’ll
stake anything your lordship likes on his good faith.
Rufus Black hung over the lady as if the ground wasn’t
good enough for her to walk on, and she smiled up at
him as loving as—as a basket of chips,” said Ryan, at
fault for a simile, and concluding his comparison rather
ignominiously. “The lady saw cabby, and says she,
blushing and smiling, ‘The gentleman will stay to
dinner, and you can put up your horses in the stable,’
says she, ‘and go into the servants’ hall and get a glass
of ale and your dinner.’ And cabby put up his horses,
and went into the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“A queer story,” muttered Atkins. “Perhaps Miss
Wynde was playing a part—pretending to love Rufus
Black in order to throw her jailers off their guard, and
so obtain a chance of escape?”</p>

<p>The young earl’s face now flushed.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he said. “It is not like Miss
Wynde to play such a part, even to effect her escape
from her enemies. She is truth incarnate. She could
never summon to her lips those false smiles; she could
never for one moment allow Rufus Black to consider
himself her favored lover.”</p>

<p>“The earl is right,” said Sir Harold. “Neva could
never play such a part. She is too truthful and straightforward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>The detective bent another quick glance at the baronet.</p>

<p>“Did the cabman make any further discoveries?” inquired
Atkins.</p>

<p>“One or two, of some importance,” said Ryan. “In
the first place, there were too few servants for so grand
a house. In the second place, the young lady, with an
older woman, had come up here within a week. In the
third place, the house-maid said that her young mistress
was called Miss Wroat, but that that was not her real
name, for the young gentleman had asked for her by
another name. And altogether, an air of mystery seems
to hang about the young lady. But the fact of the most
importance of all is, that on the way home from Heather
Hills last night, young Black got up on the box with the
cabby, and asked him no end of questions about the Scotch
laws concerning marriage—if licenses were necessary, if
publication of banns was usual, and so on. And the
young man asked him which was the best church to step
into for a quiet, informal marriage, without license or
publication of banns, but the marriage to be perfectly
legal and binding.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Atkins. “That begins to look as if he
meant business.”</p>

<p>“Young Black seemed to be in gay humor all the way
home,” said Ryan. “He sung to himself, and talked
and laughed, and acted as if he had had a fortune left to
him. And as they drove into Inverness, he told the cabby
that he wanted him to take him to church this morning
at a quarter to ten o’clock, and he told him that he was
going to be married to a great heiress whom he adored.”</p>

<p>“Is there not some mistake?” asked Lord Towyn excitedly.
“Can he be in love with some other lady?”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” said Atkins dryly. “Heiresses
are not as plenty as oat cakes in Scotland. He’s been<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
courting Miss Wynde since last July, and was dead in
love with her, as any one could see. He could not shift
his affections so soon, and fix them upon another heiress.
The young lady is Miss Wynde, fast enough. And
she is either deluding him, meaning to denounce him to
the minister at the altar, or to escape from him in Inverness,
or else her courage is weakened, and she believes
herself helpless, and has yielded to her enemies in a fit
of despair.”</p>

<p>“If she were alone upon the cliffs, she might then
have attempted an escape,” said Lord Towyn, thoroughly
puzzled. “I cannot feel that this smiling, loving bride
is Neva. I know she is not. But we will present ourselves
at the marriage, and if the bride be Neva, we will
save her!”</p>

<p>“I cannot think that she is Neva,” said Sir Harold
thoughtfully. “And yet, as Atkins says, where could
he have found another heiress so soon? And how, if he
loved Neva so devotedly, could he be so deeply in love
with this young lady who has just come up to Inverness?”</p>

<p>“She comes from Kent,” said Ryan. “The housemaid
has heard her speak of being at Canterbury within
the month.”</p>

<p>“That settles it!” cried Atkins. “It is Miss Wynde!”</p>

<p>“Ryan,” exclaimed Lord Towyn, “you must go now
and discover to what church Rufus Black is going. We
will wait here for you to guide us.”</p>

<p>Ryan bowed and departed.</p>

<p>He was gone until nearly ten o’clock, and the time
dragged heavily to Neva’s friends, who remained in their
closed sitting-room, exchanging surmises and doubts,
and preparing themselves for an encounter with Craven
Black and Octavia.</p>

<p>Sir Harold put on his greatcoat and turned up his<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
collar, and wound a gray woolen muffler about the lower
part of his face. He was standing thus disguised, hat in
hand, when Ryan came back and quietly slipped into the
room.</p>

<p>“The cab is waiting,” announced the detective. “I
have been at Rufus Black’s heels ever since I left you.
When I got back to the Caledonian, he was just going
out in his cab. I rode on top as a friend of the driver,
who was won over to make a friend of me by a gift of a
crown. We drove to the minister’s, and to the sexton’s,
and finally to a jeweller’s, where Black bought a ring.
We then went back to the hotel. And a few minutes
ago young Black entered his cab again, and gave the
order ‘to the church.’ I know the church, and we must
get on our way to reach it, if we expect to get there in
time to stop the ceremony.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold and Lord Towyn hurried impetuously out
of the room and down the stairs, and were seated in the
cab when Atkins and the detective reached the street.
These two also entered the vehicle, which rolled swiftly
down the street.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ drive brought them to the plain, substantial
kirk which had been chosen by Rufus Black as
the scene of his second marriage to Lally.</p>

<p>The four pursuers leaped from the cab, and hastily entered
the edifice by its half-opened door.</p>

<p>Passing through the dim and chilly vestibule, they
pushed open one of the baize-covered inner doors,
which swung noiselessly upon its well-oiled hinges, and
stood within the kirk.</p>

<p>It was a plain church interior, without stained glass or
lofty arched window, with bare walls and ceilings, and
with the plainest of gasoliers; the reading desk of solid
oak, beautifully carved, was yet in keeping with the
rugged simplicity of this house of worship. Here the<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
old Covenanters might have worshiped; and here their
descendants did worship, in all the stern simplicity of the
faith in which they had been trained.</p>

<p>There was no one save the pew-opener in the church
at the moment of the intrusion of Sir Harold Wynde
and his companions. The four passed silently down the
long dim aisle, and entered a tall-backed pew, in which
they were nearly hidden from view. Lord Towyn gave
the pew-opener a shilling, and they were left to themselves.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like a wedding,” said Sir Harold,
shivering in his greatcoat. “If the bridegroom came on
before us, where is he?”</p>

<p>The question was answered by the appearance of
Rufus Black and the minister from the little vestry, in
which they had gone to warm themselves. Rufus wore
his ordinary garments, but had bought a white waistcoat
and neck-tie, which gave him a clerical air. He kept
his eyes upon the door with an anxious, uneasy glance.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid she’ll give him the slip, after all,” muttered
Ryan.</p>

<p>The green baize-covered door swung open and closed
again. Rufus Black and the occupants of the high-back
pew in the corner near the reading desk alike
started, but the arrival was only that of a few persons
who had seen the open church door, and surmised that a
wedding was in progress. They questioned the pew-opener,
and subsided into pews.</p>

<p>Presently a few more curious persons appeared, and
took their seats also.</p>

<p>The occupants of the high-backed pew grew impatient.
It was after ten o’clock, an early hour for a wedding,
but the hour Rufus had himself appointed, in his
eager impatience to claim his young wife. A cold sweat
started to the young bridegroom’s face. He began to<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
think that Lally had thought better of her promise to
remarry him, and had decided to give him up for the
worthless, weak, irresolute being he knew himself to be.</p>

<p>“There’s a hitch somewhere,” said Ryan.</p>

<p>Again the baize-covered door swung open, and four
persons came slowly up the aisle.</p>

<p>It was the bridal party at last.</p>

<p>Rufus Black started forward with an irrepressible
eagerness, joy and relief. Sir Harold Wynde and Lord
Towyn, alike pale and agitated, regarded the approaching
party with burning eyes.</p>

<p>First of all came the steward of Heather Hills, with a
girlish figure clinging to his arm. Behind these two
came the steward’s wife in gray silk, and Peters in black
silk and crape, but with white ribbons at her throat, and
white lace collar and sleeves.</p>

<p>Sir Harold and the young earl looked at the three
strange figures in a sort of bewilderment. They had
expected to see Craven Black and Octavia. Not seeing
them, they fixed their glances upon Lally.</p>

<p>The young wife had laid aside her mourning for her
great-aunt upon this occasion, and wore a dress that
Mrs. Wroat had bought for her upon their memorable
shopping expedition immediately after Lally’s arrival in
London.</p>

<p>It was a delicate mauve moire, made with a long train.
Over it was worn an upper dress of filmy tulle, arranged
in foam-like puffs over all its surface. This too formed
a trail. The corsage was of puffs of tulle over the moire,
and was made low in the neck and short in the sleeves.
The bride wore a tulle vail, which fell over her face in
soft folds, and was confined to her head by an aigrette
of diamonds. Through the filmy folds of her vail the
spectators caught the gleam of diamonds on her arms
and neck and bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>The steward conducted his beautiful young charge to
the altar, and bride and bridegroom stood side by side
and the minister slowly took his place.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn made a movement to dash from his seat,
but Sir Harold caught his arm in a stern grip, and compelled
him to remain.</p>

<p>At the moment of beholding the bride, a mist had
swept over the young earl’s vision. His brain had
seemed to swim. For the instant he had scarcely
doubted, in his excitement, that it was Neva who stood
before him; but as his vision cleared, he knew that this
young bride was not his betrothed wife. He knew it,
although he could not see Lally’s face. He missed the
haughty carriage of Neva’s slender figure, the proud
poise of her small, noble head, the swaying grace of her
movements. This young bride was not so tall as Neva,
and had not Neva’s dainty imperial grace.</p>

<p>“It’s not Neva!” he whispered excitedly. “That is
Rufus Black, sure enough, but the lady is not Neva.”</p>

<p>“You can’t see her face,” said Atkins. “I think it is
Miss Wynde.”</p>

<p>At this moment the bride with a sweep of her hand,
threw back her vail. As her bright, dark face, so like a
gipsy’s and with a glow of happiness upon it, met the
gaze of the spectators, Sir Harold stifled a groan.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn stared at the pretty brown face, with its
fluctuating color, and the softly melting black eyes, and
a dead pallor covered his face.</p>

<p>If this young girl was the chosen bride of Rufus
Black, where was Neva? Why had Rufus given her up?
The wildest fears for her life and safety possessed him.</p>

<p>The marriage went on. The four pursuers who had
come to interrupt the proceedings sat in their high-backed
pew as if utterly stupefied. What objection
could they raise to the marriage of Rufus Black to a<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
stranger who came to the church escorted by her friends?
Why should they object to such a marriage? They
heard the questions and answers as in a trance. The
name of Lalla Bird sounded strangely upon their ears.
And when the minister said, “I now pronounce you man
and wife, and whom God has joined together let not
man put asunder,” Sir Harold Wynde and the young
earl looked at each other with terrified, inquiring eyes,
that asked the question that filled their souls alike:
Where was Neva?</p>

<p>After the prayer that followed the ceremony, the minister
went into the vestry, followed by the newly married
pair, the steward and his wife, and good Mrs. Peters.</p>

<p>The casual spectators of the wedding stole silently out
of the church.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve come up here on a fool’s errand,” muttered
Ryan, in a tone of chagrin.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Lord Towyn. “Rufus may be
able to give us some clue to his father’s whereabouts, if
we approach him judiciously. I am going into the vestry
to see him.”</p>

<p>“And I too,” said the baronet, rising.</p>

<p>The young earl led the way from their pew to the vestry,
Sir Harold at his side, and Mr. Atkins and Ryan
behind them.</p>

<p>The bride, all blushes and smiles, was writing her
name in the marriage register, when the young earl and
his companions entered the small room. Rufus Black
had just signed it, and was putting on his gloves. He gave
a great start as he recognized Lord Towyn and Atkins,
and stared beyond them with an unmistakable terror, as
if he expected to behold the cynical sneering face and
angry eyes of his father looming up behind the intruders.</p>

<p>“You here, my lord?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rufus,” said the young earl, holding out his<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
hand. “We happened to be at Inverness and have been
witnesses to your marriage. Permit us to congratulate
you.”</p>

<p>Rufus drew a long breath of relief and shook the
earl’s hand heartily.</p>

<p>“I thought—I thought—” he began, confused and
hesitating—“I was afraid— But never mind. It’s odd
your being up here, my lord. How do you do, Atkins?
Lally,” and Rufus turned to his young wife, who was
looking curiously at the new-comers, “here are some
friends of mine, up from Kent. Lord Towyn, Lally, and
Mr. Atkins of Canterbury.”</p>

<p>Lally blushed and acknowledged the introduction
gracefully.</p>

<p>“Can we see you in the church a moment, Mr. Black?”
asked Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>Rufus consented, with that look of fear again in his
eyes. He apologized for a moment’s absence to his
bride and her friends, who were now signing their names
to the register, and accompanied his pursuers back into
the church. His face brightened when he found that his
father was not in waiting for him in the church.</p>

<p>“You have a pretty young bride, Rufus,” said the
young earl pleasantly. “We have followed you up from
Kent, with the idea that you were on your way to Miss
Wynde. It was in this way we happened to be at your
wedding. Is Mrs. Rufus Black a recent acquaintance?”</p>

<p>Rufus hesitated, with a quick glance at Sir Harold’s
muffled face and figure. Then he said bravely, resolving
to act upon his new principles of straightforwardness
and courage:</p>

<p>“It is an odd story, Lord Towyn. I have been married
before to my wife to whom I was married this
morning. My father separated me from her and I read
in a London paper that she was dead. I discovered<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
my mistake the other day in London. I met her in a
picture-shop. She came off to Scotland that night, and
I found her yesterday. She is an heiress now, my lord,
but the same true and loving wife she used to be. I
was desperate at her loss; I was half mad, I think,
when I asked Miss Wynde to marry me. I never loved
any one but my own wife, and I beg you to say to Miss
Wynde for me, that I send my best wishes for her happiness,
and I should be glad to witness her marriage
with you, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Rufus. But where is Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>A look of genuine surprise appeared in Rufus Black’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, she is at Wynde Heights, with my father and
her step-mother,” he answered.</p>

<p>“She is not there. They have not been there. They
have conveyed her to some lonely place, where they
hope to subdue her into consenting to marry you,” said
Lord Towyn. “Can you give us no clue to their
whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, my lord. My father said they were
going to Wynde Heights, and ordered me to hold
myself in readiness to come to him at a moment’s warning.
I have not heard from him since he left Hawkhurst.
I am now of age, and have flung off my father’s
authority forever. I know no more than you do, my
lord, where my father can have gone. But one thing is
sure. When he sees the announcement of my marriage
in the <cite>Times</cite>, he’ll give up the game, and bring Miss
Wynde back to her home.”</p>

<p>“He may not dare to do that,” said Atkins. “He
has carried matters with too high a hand, and has gone
too far to make an easy retreat. Has your father any
property, Mr. Black?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>“About three hundred a year,” said Rufus. “His
wife is rich.”</p>

<p>“I mean, does he own any real estate?”</p>

<p>Rufus smiled, shook his head, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said doubtfully. “I believe he
does own a small estate somewhere, but it never brought
him in a penny. It is barren, unproductive, and out of
the world.”</p>

<p>“The very place to which he would have gone!”
cried Atkins. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Rufus. “You see my
father never talked of his affairs to me. In fact, I never
lived with him. I was always at school, and we were
more like strangers, or master and serf, than like father
and son. His property may be in Wales, and it may be
elsewhere. I believe there are mountains near it or
around it, but I am not sure. Indeed, my lord, almost
any one who ever knew my father can tell you more
about his affairs than I can.”</p>

<p>Rufus spoke with a plain sincerity that convinced his
hearers of his truthfulness.</p>

<p>“We have had our journey to Scotland for nothing,”
said Atkins.</p>

<p>Ryan looked crestfallen.</p>

<p>“We will detain you no longer, Rufus,” said Lord
Towyn, a shadow darkening his fair and noble face.
“Make our excuses to your bride for taking you from
her so soon after your marriage, and accept our best
wishes for your future prosperity and happiness. And
now good-morning.”</p>

<p>With an exchange of courtesies and friendly greetings
the party broke up, Rufus Black returning to his
young wife and her wondering friends, to make all necessary
apologies for his absence from them, and Lord<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
Towyn and his companions making their way into the
street.</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?” demanded the young earl,
as they paused at the open door of the cab.</p>

<p>Sir Harold looked at his daughter’s lover with haggard
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am worn out with excitement and fatigue,” said
the baronet, in a low, weary voice. “I will go back to
the hotel and lie down. I must not become worn out.
Heaven knows I shall need all my strength.”</p>

<p>“And you, Atkins?” said Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>“I shall try to catch a nap also,” said the solicitor
gloomily. “I’m tired too. I can’t stand it to go banging
back to Kent by the first south-bound train.”</p>

<p>“And you, Ryan?” asked the earl.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the detective. “I want to think
over what has happened, and see if I can get any new
ideas.”</p>

<p>He raised his hat, and walked away.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a stroll about the town, Sir Harold,” said
the earl. “I feel strangely restless, and not at all sleepy.
I slept very well last night on the train—as well as I
have slept since Neva disappeared. I’ll meet you and
Atkins in our sitting-room at the Railway Hotel by four
o’clock.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold and Atkins entered the cab, and were
driven to their hotel. The young earl watched the cab
until it disappeared from sight, and then he walked
down the street, idly taking his way toward the river.</p>

<p>The wind blew strong and fiercely—a very winter
wind, as cold and keen as if it blew directly from the
North pole, and having suggestions of icebergs in it.
The young earl shivered, and drew up his coat collar.</p>

<p>“Pretty weather for this season,” he muttered. “The<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
gale of night before last has not quite blown itself out,
and is giving us a few parting puffs.”</p>

<p>He walked down to the wharves and stood by the
water’s edge, his hat pulled over his fair brows to keep
it on, his hands in his pockets, the very picture of a careless
saunterer, but a great wave of despair was surging
in his heart.</p>

<p>“My poor Neva!” he said to himself. “Where is she
this wild day? Does she begin to think I am never
coming to rescue her?”</p>

<p>His wild glances, straying over the boats in the river,
settled at that instant upon a graceful yacht just coming
to anchor. He could read on her stern her name—<em>The
Arrow</em>. He watched her idly for a long time. He saw
a boat lowered from her deck, and two sailors descend
into it. A gentleman in greatcoat and tall silk hat followed
them, and was rowed toward the shore.</p>

<p>The young earl started, his blue eyes flaming. Something
in the attitude and carriage of the gentleman excited
his keenest scrutiny. As the boat came nearer, and the
faces of its occupants were revealed more plainly, a
strange cry sprang to Lord Towyn’s lips. He had
recognized in the tall stranger gentleman his own and
Neva’s enemy—Craven Black!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TROUBLE AHEAD FOR THE PLOTTERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a strange fatality that had brought Craven
Black to Inverness at the very time when his enemies
were there, engaged in a search for him.</p>

<p>The cold weather had set in early in his Highland retreat,
and already a foretaste of winter reigned in the
Wilderness. Octavia’s cold had settled upon her lungs,
and she coughed dismally, and in a way that made Artress
tremble lest the wealth upon which they all counted and
Octavia’s life should die out together. Medicine was
needed imperatively, and so were all manner of winter
supplies: and it was for these things Craven Black had
ventured from his stronghold like some beast of prey,
and when he should have obtained them he intended to
return to the Wilderness, and there wait patiently until
Neva should yield to his infamous demands that she
should wed his son.</p>

<p>He sprang nimbly from the boat on reaching the wharf,
and taking the cigar from his mouth, said, in a voice
loud enough to convey his words to the ears of Lord
Towyn, whom he had not even seen:</p>

<p>“I am going up among the shops, boys, to make my
purchases. I shall go nowhere except to the shops, for
I don’t want to incur any risks. Be guarded, and say
nothing to any one about your business or employer.
I sha’n’t go aboard under two or three hours, and you
can spend the time in some gin-shop. Here’s a crown
to divide between you, but don’t get drunk. Remember,
we must get all our stores aboard early and be off at<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
daybreak in the morning. Be back at the boat here in
a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>The men assented and took the money given them,
hurrying away. Craven Black walked in an opposite
direction, and was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn turned his gaze on the yacht. He saw
that a man had been left in charge of the yacht, for the
captain stood on the deck smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>A waterman was rowing along the river near the
wharves, and Lord Towyn signalled him. He came up
swiftly to the edge of the wharf upon which the young
earl stood, and doffed his tarpaulin.</p>

<p>“Row me out to the yacht yonder,” said Lord Towyn,
springing into the boat. “I’ll board her on the further
side.”</p>

<p>He sat down and the waterman pulled lustily out into
the stream. In a very brief space of time the boat
had crept into the shadow of the yacht on its further
side, and the young earl climbed lightly to the deck.</p>

<p>The captain approached him, scowling.</p>

<p>“Hallo, you there; what do you want?” he demanded
gruffly. “This here’s a private yacht, sir.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed,” said his lordship coolly. “It belongs
to Mr. Craven Black, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The pipe fell from the captain’s hands. He changed
color.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it makes no difference who it belongs
to,” he said blustering. “I work for pay, and it
makes no difference to nobody who I work for. Get out
of this, young man!”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said Lord Towyn sternly, his blue
eyes blazing with a light that terrified the captain.
“None of your bluff, fellow. It won’t work with me.
I know with whom I am dealing. You are the servant
of Craven Black, and what have you to urge against my<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
having you indicted with him for the abduction of Miss
Wynde?”</p>

<p>The captain fairly gasped for breath. He looked helplessly
toward the shore.</p>

<p>“I haven’t done nothing,” he muttered presently,
quailing under the steady, fixed and stern gaze of the
earl’s blue eyes. “I’ve hired as cap’n, and I am cap’n;
but that’s all. On my soul, I an’t no party to no
abduction.”</p>

<p>“Your past character will be examined to throw light
upon your present motives and doings,” said the earl,
with a telling random shot.</p>

<p>The captain winced and quavered.</p>

<p>“Now see here, my man,” said Lord Towyn, following
up his advantage. “If you have done anything
wrong in the past, it will be like a leaden weight to
drag you down when the officers of the law arrest you
for assisting in the abduction of Miss Wynde. It makes
no difference to you whom I am. Your game is up.
The officers of the law have accompanied us up from
London. There are four of us in all upon the trail of
Craven Black. Refuse to do as I tell you, and I’ll call
yonder policeman on the wharf and give you up on the
charge of abducting a lady of rank and fortune.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?” the captain asked falteringly.
“I haven’t had my pay from Mr. Black, and
he’ll kill me if I betray him.”</p>

<p>“He need not know that you have betrayed him,” said
our hero. “You need not leave this vessel. All that
you have to do to secure your safety is this: Tell me
exactly the whereabouts of Miss Wynde, and her friends
will follow the yacht at a safe distance, quite out of sight
from your deck, and you can remain on board and collect
your pay of Mr. Black. He need not suspect that
you have betrayed him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>“And what will I gain by betraying him?”</p>

<p>“Your freedom from arrest. You see the policeman
still stands on the wharf? So sure as you refuse to
speak, and speak quickly, I’ll call him!”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn meant what he said, and the captain comprehended
the fact. He saw that Craven Black had
been caught in a trap, and with the usual instinct of villainy,
he resolved to save himself from the general ruin.</p>

<p>“You swear that I shall be protected if I tell the
truth?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s penal servitude for abducting a young
lady,” said the captain. “Jack said so last night. Blamed
if I haven’t been sick of the job, anyhow. I don’t mind
a mutiny at sea, when there’s cause, but I can’t relish
making war on a helpless girl, and I haven’t from the
first.”</p>

<p>“Come to the point. Where is Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>“At a place up in the mountains owned by Mr. Black,
and called the Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde is there, and Mrs. Craven Black?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the servants, and Mrs. Artress.”</p>

<p>“How far from here is the Wilderness?”</p>

<p>“About twenty miles, if you could go direct, which
you can’t. It’s forty miles by water. You know Cromarty Frith,
up in Ross—and—Cromarty?”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn assented.</p>

<p>“You go about half-way up the Frith and turn into a
river that leads up among the mountains. The stream
grows narrower as you ascend, but the water remains
deep, and at last your boat fetches into a small loch
lying at the foot of the mountains and surrounded by
them. A steep mountain rises right before you. Half-way
up its side lies a wide ledge, and on that the house
is built. It’s a wild-looking spot, sir, and a dreary one.<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
It’s mighty cold up there, and I haven’t relished the prospect
of spending the winter there, not by no means.”</p>

<p>The earl asked several questions, to make himself conversant
with the route, and also to make sure that the
man was not lying to him. Assured on this point, he
said:</p>

<p>“Craven Black intends to return home in the morning.
He must not suspect that you have betrayed him.
Keep the secret, and we will do so.”</p>

<p>The captain’s look of fear showed conclusively that he
would be careful not to allow his employer to suspect
his treachery.</p>

<p>After a few further words, Lord Towyn re-entered
his boat and returned to the shore.</p>

<p>“Anything more, sir?” asked the waterman, as the
boat ground against the wharf.</p>

<p>“Nothing more—unless,” added the earl, with a sudden
thought, “you could direct me to a small vessel, a
fast sailer, that I could hire for a day or two. I should
want a couple of men to take charge of her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any such boat,” said the waterman,
scratching his head. “And yet <em>The Lucky</em> might suit
you, sir, though it isn’t a gentleman’s boat. She’s built
for a fishing vessel, is brand-new, and had a trial sail the
day afore the gale, when she went like a bird.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see her. Take me out to her.”</p>

<p><em>The Lucky</em> lay out in the stream, half a mile further
inland. Lord Towyn rowed out to her, and found her
joint-owners, two brothers, on board. He went over
the vessel, and found it new and clean, and in fine order.
The owners were willing to let the little craft with their
services, and the young earl hired it for a week, paying
in advance twice the sum the thrifty Scotsmen demanded
for it.</p>

<p>“She must be provisioned immediately,” said Lord<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
Towyn. “Her destination is a secret, which I will tell
you in the morning. I have three friends who will make
the excursion with me. We shall want blankets, and all
kinds of cooked meats and stores. We must leave Inverness
at day-break. Come ashore with me, one of you,
and I will select the stores we are likely to need.”</p>

<p>One of the brothers accompanied the earl ashore, and
conducted him to various shops, Lord Towyn keeping a
keen look-out for Craven Black, in order to avoid him.</p>

<p>Blankets and mattresses and bed linen were sent down
to <em>The Lucky</em>; various kinds of cooked meats, including
rounds of roast beef, roasted chickens, meat puddings,
ham and veal pies, smoked salmon and boiled ham, were
packed in hampers and sent aboard; and Lord Towyn
added baskets of fruits, both dried and fresh, and jams
and confitures of every sort in abundance, besides boxes
of biscuits of every description.</p>

<p>“It looks like a v’y’ge to Ingy,” said Macdonald, the
one of the two brothers who had accompanied Lord
Towyn ashore, contemplating the array of stores with
kindling eyes. “We can provision a ship’s crew to
Australy.”</p>

<p>“Whatever is left, you will be welcome to,” said the
earl, smiling.</p>

<p>The young lord saw his new purchases deposited on
board <em>The Lucky</em>, and himself attended to the arrangement
of the little cabin, and then paying his waterman
liberally, he returned to his hotel.</p>

<p>The day had passed swiftly, and he found that it was
nearly five o’clock of the short afternoon, and the street
lamps were lighted, when he entered his hotel and went
up stairs, two steps at a time, to his sitting-room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE FINAL MOVE IMPENDING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The young Lord Towyn came into his sitting-room
and the presence of his friends like a sunny south
breeze, all hopefulness and gladness. He found Sir
Harold walking the floor, his head bowed upon his
breast, his face ghastly pale, his eyes haggard, his mind
bordering upon distraction. The father’s anxieties concerning
his missing daughter was almost more than the
overstrung brain and tortured heart could bear.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins stood at the window, sullenly despairing.</p>

<p>Ryan, completely at his wit’s end, sat before the blazing
fire in a crouching attitude, and with crestfallen
visage.</p>

<p>Sir Harold, Atkins and Ryan turned, as by one impulse,
toward the young earl, as he bounded lightly into
the room. Their eyes expressed their wonder at the
change a few hours had wrought in him.</p>

<p>“You look like incarnate sunshine, Arthur,” said the
baronet sadly. “Ah, the elastic spirit of youth!”</p>

<p>The young lord laughed joyously, his fair face aglow
with the gladness that filled his being. He took off his
greatcoat and hat, great drops of sleet or rain falling
from it, and shook himself, as he said:</p>

<p>“There’s a mist beginning to fall. We shall have a
wet day to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold looked more keenly at the young earl, and
a sudden excitement possessed him.</p>

<p>“What has happened, Arthur?” he demanded. “You
have news of Neva?”</p>

<p>The glad smiles rippled like waves of sunlight over<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
the young lord’s mouth, and a joyous light danced in his
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I have news of Neva.”</p>

<p>In an instant, Sir Harold, Atkins and Ryan crowded
around our hero, all eagerness and excitement.</p>

<p>“Is she here, at Inverness?” cried Atkins. “Have you
seen her?”</p>

<p>“No; she is hidden among the Highlands, up in Ross
and Cromarty. She is safe and well.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know it?” demanded Ryan, full of
professional zeal and jealousy at once.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn took in his own the right hand of Sir
Harold and pressed it, as he answered gravely:</p>

<p>“I have seen Craven Black!”</p>

<p>A series of exclamations burst from the earl’s hearers.
Sir Harold Wynde trembled like a leaf, and turned
his back upon the keen-eyed detective.</p>

<p>“Black is here?” ejaculated Ryan, all thoughts of
“the mysterious Mr. Hunlow” lost in his sudden amazement.
“Then our trip to Scotland was not a wild-goose
chase, after all? Tell me where he is, my lord;”
and Ryan took a step toward the door.</p>

<p>“Leave the management of the affair to me for the
present, Ryan,” said Lord Towyn. “You have placed
us on the right track, and you shall have all the credit
for doing so, but we want no arrests, no noise, no scandal.
The matter must be hushed up for family reasons.
No whisper must go forth to the world of the wickedness
of Lady Wynde. The failure of the conspirators
must be their punishment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Sir Harold. “The earl is right.
There must be no scandal.”</p>

<p>The detective shot a keen glance at the baronet,
whose back was still toward him.</p>

<p>“I have discovered,” continued Lord Towyn, “that<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
Craven Black has an old house up in the Highlands, and
that he has Neva there in close imprisonment. Neva
has all the courage for which we gave her credit, and
holds out stoutly against her enemies. Black apprehends
a long stay in the Highlands while reducing her
to subjection, and has come to Inverness to-day for winter
stores. His yacht lies in the river, and he will be
off at daybreak.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” exclaimed Atkins. “He will
escape us. It will be necessary to arrest him.”</p>

<p>“I have made all the preparations for pursuit,”
replied our hero. “I have a sloop, provisioned and
ready, in which we will follow the yacht. We will dine
here, and at a late hour this evening we will go aboard
our vessel. We must be off in the morning, soon after
the yacht.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold plied the earl with questions, and the latter
told the tale of his day’s adventures at full length.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, dinner was served in their sitting-room.
After dinner they talked for hours, and at ten
o’clock that evening they quitted their hotel and went
down to the wharf.</p>

<p>A fine mist was falling. The river was shrouded in
darkness, but watery gleams of light came from the
yacht and the other vessels lying in the river. The wind
was still strong and free, blowing in fitful gusts.</p>

<p>The party had hardly come to a halt upon the wharf,
when a small boat manned by two rowers shot out of
the gloom, and ran along-side the landing-place.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Macdonald?” asked the young earl, bending
forward and straining his eyes through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir. Is it you, my lord!” said Macdonald,
in a loud whisper, rising in the boat.</p>

<p>“You are on time,” said Lord Towyn. “The clock is
striking the hour at this moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>The earl assisted Sir Harold into the boat, and sprang
in after him. Atkins and Ryan followed, and the boat
shot out again into the stream. A vigorous row of
several minutes on the part of the brothers Macdonald,
brought the party alongside <em>The Lucky</em>, and they
climbed to her deck. The boat was drawn up and secured
to the davits.</p>

<p>The young earl led the way out of the wet and gloom
down into the cabin. There was no fire here, but a
lantern hung from the ceiling, shedding a bright light
upon the table and the bench around it. The air was
chilly, and the small cabin, despite its snugness, had the
comfortless appearance usual to a ship’s cabin.</p>

<p>“It’s cold here,” said the elder Macdonald, the captain
of the sloop. “I’ll just mix you a punch. There’s
nothing like a good punch to keep the rheumatiz out of
one’s bones.”</p>

<p>He brought from the pantry a spirit lamp, which he
lighted. Over this, upon a light frame-work, he placed
a tea-kettle. Then he brought out an immense bowl
and ladle, a netted bag full of lemons, a tin can of sugar,
various spices, and a jug of Scotch whisky. When the
water in the tea-kettle boiled, he rolled up his sleeves
and set to work, concocting a punch which proved a
success. The four passengers, as well as the two Macdonalds,
did full justice to the warming beverage.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock Sir Harold Wynde was persuaded
to retire to a state-room and berth, but he did not sleep.
A host of anxieties pressed upon him, and he tossed for
hours on his hard bed, the prey of a torturing anguish.</p>

<p>Atkins and Ryan went to bed, and to sleep.</p>

<p>Lord Towyn went out upon the deck, and walked to
and fro with Macdonald, whom he found to be a shrewd,
kindly Scotsman, and he told him enough concerning
the misdeeds of Craven Black, and the abduction of<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
Miss Wynde, to interest him personally in the restoration
of Neva to her friends.</p>

<p>“We must keep an eye upon the yacht all night,” said
the earl. “She may creep out in the darkness, and if
she attempts that, we will creep after. I know the route
she will take, but I prefer to arrive at the inland loch
not an hour behind her.”</p>

<p>“I will keep watch,” said Macdonald. “You ought
to get a little sleep, my lord.”</p>

<p>“I cannot sleep,” answered Lord Towyn, more to himself
than to his new ally. “My veins seem full of quicksilver
to-night, rather than full of blood. So near to
her—so near!”</p>

<p>He paced the deck alone in the mist and the darkness.
Around him the watery gleams of light flickered upon
the river, and from the wharves other watery gleams
strayed, looking like reflections of the first. The bells
rang the hours with muffled clangor. A strange ghostliness
fell upon the dark river and the sleeping city.</p>

<p>All through the night Lord Towyn continued his
weary tramping to and fro upon the deck. One of the
Macdonalds shared his vigil; the other slept.</p>

<p><em>The Arrow</em> lay quietly at her moorings throughout the
night, but at daybreak signs of activity were seen upon
her deck. The morning had not fairly dawned when
the yacht slipped out of the stream, heading toward
Moray Frith.</p>

<p>The breeze was favorable to her progress, without
being astern, and she bowled away at a fine rate of
speed. The young earl, looking through a sea glass,
could distinguish four figures upon the deck of <em>The
Arrow</em>, and one of these he recognized as that of Craven
Black.</p>

<p>“Shall we shake out the sails, my lord?” asked the
elder Macdonald. “The yacht goes well, but I fancy<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
we might show her the heels of <em>The Lucky</em> in a fair race.
We can keep her in sight the whole distance.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do, Macdonald. Black must not suspect
he’s followed. This mist is like a vail, and will conceal
us if we keep at a reasonable distance behind. Let him
get half way to Fort George, and then we will start.”</p>

<p>In good time, when <em>The Arrow</em> had made about the
distance indicated as desirable, <em>The Lucky</em> slipped from
her moorings, and shaking out her sails as a bird shakes
its wings, she flew onward over the waters in pursuit.</p>

<p>The sloop was half-way to the fort, and the yacht was
out of sight, when the baronet, fully dressed, and showing
by his haggard face that he had not slept during the
night, came out upon the deck.</p>

<p>The young earl took Sir Harold’s arm and they walked
the deck together, conversing in low tones.</p>

<p>A little later, Mr. Atkins and Ryan appeared, and
the four passengers adjourned to the cabin, where the
younger Macdonald, who acted as steward, had set out
upon the cabin table a formidable array of cold meats,
bread, biscuits, and fruits, both fresh and preserved. A
pot of hot coffee had also been provided, and a bowl of
hot punch was ready for those who preferred it.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the passengers returned to the deck.</p>

<p>They passed Fort George in good time, and came out
into the rougher waters of the Moray Frith. Here their
progress was less rapid. <em>The Lucky</em> lurched somewhat;
but when she turned into the straits, and finally emerged
into the smoother waters of Cromarty Frith, she was
moving as steadily, although by no means as swiftly, as
a bird upon the wing.</p>

<p><em>The Arrow</em> was out of sight, and Macdonald crowded
on all the sail the small sloop would bear. It was well
he did so, for as the day wore on the wind grew shifty,
and sometimes blew dead ahead, and the average rate of<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
speed up the Cromarty Frith did not exceed four miles
an hour.</p>

<p>It was after midday when they turned into the river
which led to the loch of the Wilderness. Lord Towyn
recognized the stream by the description that had been
given him, and unhesitatingly directed an advance. Sir
Harold and Mr. Atkins had many misgivings as the sloop
crept slowly up the river, a mere deep cut between high
hills, their progress like the snail’s, but they did not
venture to express it to their hopeful and confident
young guide.</p>

<p>As the stream grew narrower their misgivings increased,
and the young earl read their thoughts in their
grave faces.</p>

<p>“Courage!” he said, approaching the baronet. “It
is true we barely creep along here, and the day is wearing
on, but the yacht has had to go slowly here also, and
cannot be more than an hour in advance of us.”</p>

<p>“But, Arthur,” suggested the baronet, giving voice to
his apprehensions, “suppose that the man of the yacht
deceived you as to the proper route, or that we have
taken the wrong course in running up this river? I
can’t believe that any one can make a cut in the hills like
this one an approach even to a Highland stronghold.
No wind can strike our sails, or so little, at any rate,
that we could easily walk faster than we sail, if only we
had a level road to walk on. And if we <em>are</em> upon the
wrong tack, what will become of Neva, my poor wronged
little Neva?”</p>

<p>His voice trembled as he asked the question.</p>

<p>“I know we are going straight to her, Sir Harold,”
said the earl hopefully. “Believe and trust in my convictions.
You may smile at the idea, but I feel that I am
getting nearer and nearer to Neva with every inch we
gain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>The night closed in early in that wild Highland
region, a night of wind and mist. Not a light gleamed
from the deck of <em>The Lucky</em>, as she felt her way between
the narrowing rocks. About six o’clock of the early
evening, she glided from the narrow river with a sudden
bound, as a puff of wind filled her flapping sails, into
the hidden loch of the Wilderness.</p>

<p>The yacht lay at anchor at the further side of the loch,
and a mile away. A lantern hung at her masthead, and
the forms of men were seen in the spectral glare, moving
hurriedly to and fro on her deck.</p>

<p>“We have come to the right place, you see,” said
Lord Towyn exultantly. “This is the loch. Yonder
lies the yacht, but recently come in. The men are busy
unloading their purchases.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold and Atkins swept the bold and rocky shores
with their keen glances. The rugged steeps were black
and bare, and in the dense gloom they saw no gleaming
lights, no signs of habitation.</p>

<p>“We must come to anchor up in the deeper shadow
of this overhanging cliff,” said Lord Towyn.</p>

<p>The order was obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now lower a boat,” said the earl. “We will go
ashore.”</p>

<p>The boat was lowered; the two McDonalds and the
four passengers entered it, and the boat was rowed
toward the yacht, keeping close to the black shore.</p>

<p>As they drew near, a row-boat was seen to shoot away
from the yacht. The McDonalds held their oars uplifted
until the yacht’s boat had grounded on the shore,
and the three seamen belonging to the yacht had landed.
Two of the three employes of Craven Black loaded
themselves with hampers and parcels, and the third
preceded them up the steep and circuitous path in the<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
mountain side, bearing a lantern which he swung at his
side.</p>

<p>“They are all gone up the cliff,” said the earl. “No
one is left to watch the shore. Strike out, men. Let
us land and follow them up the mountain. The man
with the lantern shall guide us as well as his comrades.”</p>

<p>To say was to do. The sloop’s boat speedily grounded
on the strip of beach, and Lord Towyn leaped out and
sought for the entrance to the narrow path up which
the three figures were slowly climbing, one still waving
his light. The path was found. The earl bade the boatmen
wait, and the four men, Lord Towyn, Sir Harold
Wynde, Mr. Atkins and Ryan, glided up the path toward
the Wilderness like so many shadows.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE END OF THE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The yacht had arrived at the loch at the foot of Wilderness
mountain just as the dusk was falling. Craven
Black had immediately gone ashore in the mist and
gloom, climbed the rugged steep, and hastened to his
temporary home. The windows were all uncurtained,
and a broad stream of watery light penetrated for a little
distance into the darkness. There was no sound of
barking of dogs, and the silence struck upon Craven
Black’s ears strangely. The front door stood wide open,
but no one was in the hall.</p>

<p>He entered the house and looked into the drawing-room.
Mrs. Artress was there, pale and perturbed, a
restless spark in her ashen eyes, and disorder in her attire.<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
She uttered an exclamation as she beheld Mr.
Black, and sprang toward him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I am so glad you are come, Craven. Have you got
the medicines for Octavia?”</p>

<p>“Yes. How is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I am very anxious about her. She
looks like death, and her breathing is very strange. She
won’t lie down, but just wanders about the house like
some restless ghost. I think that her lungs are congested,
and that she is in serious danger. I really think
you ought to take her to Inverness and put her in a
physician’s care. What if she should die in this remote
Wilderness?”</p>

<p>“She won’t die while she is able to ‘wander about
the house,’” responded Craven Black lightly. “When
people are seriously ill they take to their beds. Why
are the dogs shut up?”</p>

<p>“Octavia ordered it. She could not bear their noise;
it drove her wild, she said.”</p>

<p>“Humph. Nervous. She will be better of her cold
in a day or two. How is Miss Wynde?”</p>

<p>“She is still obstinate, Craven, and never says a word
against her starvation diet. I am afraid we’ve made a
serious mistake in our estimate of her. She is what you
sometimes call ‘game all through.’ She’ll die, but she
won’t give in. I wish we had left her alone, and allowed
her to marry whom she pleased. That escapade of hers
on the mountain may cost Octavia her life. And if
Octavia dies, her four thousand a year dies too, and I
shall have to become a companion to some lady, and lead
a horrible life of dependence and fear, and you will
have to go back to your precarious existence.”</p>

<p>“You are a pleasant comforter,” said Craven Black
impatiently. “All these horrors exist only in your<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
imagination. Octavia will outlive us all. Where is
she?”</p>

<p>“In her own room.”</p>

<p>Black ran up the stairs to his wife’s room. He found
Octavia standing before the fire, clad in a loose wrapper,
whose bright hue made her pallid face look hideous.
Her eyes were strangely large, and they were thrown
into relief by heavy black circles under them. Her long
black hair hung loosely down her back. She looked thin
and old and spectral, all the brightness and beauty gone
from her. Her features were hard in their expression,
and the wicked soul declared itself plainly in her unlovely
countenance.</p>

<p>Craven Black recoiled at sight of her. How two or
three days had changed her! He felt a sudden repugnance
to her. He had a horror of weakness and illness,
and a fear came over him that his cousin’s terrors might
not be without foundation.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Craven?” cried Octavia, in a thin, querulous
voice. “How long you have stayed. Did you
get my medicine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is,” and Black produced a bottle from
his pocket. “It’s a cough mixture.”</p>

<p>“I feel such a tightness here,” and Octavia put her
hand upon her chest. “Such a horrible restriction. I
dare say, though it will be all right in the morning. I
remember, Craven, you hate sick people. Your dinner
is waiting. Let us go down.”</p>

<p>“You had better go to bed,” said Craven abruptly.</p>

<p>“I cannot lie down. My chest pains me when I attempt
it. Had you good luck at Inverness?”</p>

<p>Craven Black assented.</p>

<p>“Did you see any one you knew?”</p>

<p>“No; how should I? None of my acquaintances come
to the Highlands in November. I was as unrecognized<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
at Inverness as I should be in Patagonia. I will change
my clothes and take you down to dinner.”</p>

<p>He went into his dressing-room and changed his garments.
Octavia paced the room restlessly during his
absence. He returned in the course of some minutes
and escorted his wife down to the dining-room, where
Mrs. Artress joined them.</p>

<p>He noticed that Octavia ate nothing at the meal. She
complained of a lack of appetite, and moved restlessly
in her chair, starting at every sound.</p>

<p>“I have read of the ancients placing a death’s head at
their feasts,” said Black grimly, “and I seem to have
followed their customs. Octavia, do try to look like
something better than a galvanized corpse.”</p>

<p>Octavia arose and went to the window, a spasm of
pain convulsing her hard features. The heartless mockery
of her confederate in guilt smote upon her in that
hour of suffering like an avenging sword. How she had
loved him, and had sinned for him! And this was her
reward!</p>

<p>Craven Black finished his dinner quietly, and drank
his wine. Then he arose with an air of gayety, and said:</p>

<p>“I have everything you sent for, Octavia, and some
things you neglected to send for. We can stand a siege
in this old house all winter, if need be. The boys are
already bringing up the hampers. Will you have a look
at them?”</p>

<p>Octavia assented with a heavy sigh, and passed out
into the front hall with Craven Black and Mrs. Artress.</p>

<p>The three seamen stood in the hall, one with a lantern
in his hand, the other two in the act of depositing their
hampers upon the floor.</p>

<p>And over the edge of the plateau at that very moment
and not a score of rods distant, four men were coming<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
silently and slowly, with stern faces and cautious mien,
toward the house.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said Craven Black, examining the
hampers. “Bring up the wine baskets next.”</p>

<p>The three men went out. The four pursuers stood in
the shadow of the trees as they passed, and then resumed
their approach to the dwelling.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see how the girl stands her imprisonment,”
said Craven Black. “I’ll let her know that we are prepared
to spend the winter here. By the way, Octavia, I
posted that second letter to Brussels to-day, addressed
under cover of a letter to Celeste’s sister, to Lord Towyn.
We have nicely hood-winked the earl, and I should like
the girl to know of our successful manœuvres. Where is
Celeste?”</p>

<p>“In Neva’s ante-room.”</p>

<p>“Come then. We will visit our prisoner.”</p>

<p>He went upstairs, Octavia following slowly, assisted by
Mrs. Artress. Celeste sat at work in the ante-room of
Neva’s chamber, and admitted the visitors into Neva’s
presence, entering with them.</p>

<p>And outside the house, upon the lawn, the four shadows
came nearer and yet nearer. They flitted up the
steps of the porch, and in at the open door. They paused
a moment in the deserted lower hall, and then, hearing
voices above, came silently and darkly up the stairs, and
paused at the door of the ante-room.</p>

<p>That room was deserted. The light streamed from the
inner room, where Neva and her enemies were grouped.
The sound of voices came out to the intruders. Softly,
with sternly eager faces, the four crept across the floor
of the ante-room, and two—Sir Harold Wynde and Lord
Towyn—looked in upon the Blacks and their young
victim.</p>

<p>The earl breathed hard, and would have leaped in like<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
a lion to the rescue of his betrothed and to the confusion
of his enemies, but Sir Harold Wynde held him back with
a grasp of iron. The baronet meant to learn the falseness
and perfidy of the wife he had so idolized and
trusted, from her own lips.</p>

<p>And with what unconscious frankness she bared her
guilty soul to his scrutiny. How completely she revealed
her wickedness to him.</p>

<p>At the moment the intruders looked in with burning
eyes upon them, Octavia was speaking. Neva stood up
near the fire, very pale and slender and fragile of figure,
as her father and lover saw with swelling hearts, but her
red-brown eyes glowed with the light of an undying
courage, her head was poised haughtily upon her slender
throat, and her lips were curled in a smile of dauntless
defiance.</p>

<p>“You see, Craven,” Octavia was saying querulously.
“We have starved the girl; we have fed her for weeks on
bread and water, until her bodily strength must be nearly
gone, and yet she stands there and defies us. What are
we to do with her?”</p>

<p>“Miss Wynde does not sufficiently realize her own
helplessness and our power,” said Craven Black. “Your
friends think you traveling with us upon the Continent,
Miss Neva. I have posted to-day a letter apparently in
your handwriting, under cover to a friend in Brussels, who
will post it back to England. That letter is addressed
to Lord Towyn. How he will kiss and caress it, and wear
it in his bosom, never doubting that you wrote it. I shall
send him another letter next week, in your name, breaking
your engagement with him.”</p>

<p>The young earl made a slight movement but Sir Harold
held him still in a grip of iron.</p>

<p>Neva’s pure, proud face flushed with scorn <a id="Ref_243" href="#BRef_243">for</a> her
enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“You may send as many letters as you please to Lord
Towyn,” she said haughtily, “but you will not deceive
him so readily as you did me with that letter purporting
to come from papa. Oh, Octavia, I am glad papa
never lived to know you as you are, base, treacherous,
and full of double-dealing! It is well for him that he
did not live, for you would have broken his noble heart.
He loved and trusted you, and you have repaid him by
oppressing his daughter whom he loved.”</p>

<p>The hard, haggard features of Octavia distorted themselves
in a sneer.</p>

<p>The baronet wondered with a sudden horror if this
was the woman he had loved. She looked a very Medusa
to him now.</p>

<p>“Your father! Your ‘poor papa!’” mocked Octavia,
with her hand upon her chest. “You have flung Sir
Harold’s name and memory at me ever since we came
to this place. And what was Sir Harold? A mere
Moneybags to me, that’s all. If you hope to move me
to pity you, you couldn’t use a worse name to give effect
to your appeal than the name of your father. I never
loved Sir Harold Wynde, but I married him because he
was rich. You needn’t look so horrified. People marry
for such reasons every day, but they have not my frankness
to avow it. There stands the man whom I have
loved for years,” and she pointed at Craven Black. “It
is his son whom I intend you shall marry—”</p>

<p>“To enrich you, madam!” cried Neva.</p>

<p>“Yes, to enrich me, since you say so?” exclaimed
Octavia. “You have seventy thousand pounds a year;
I have four thousand. I intend to equalize matters before
you and I separate. Craven has just returned from
Inverness with household stores sufficient to last us
through the winter, and we will stay here till spring, if
necessary to compel you to accede to our wishes. Your<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
fare, every day through this winter, until you yield to
us, shall be bread and water. I warn you not to carry
your resistance too far for I may be moved to deprive
you of a fire.”</p>

<p>Neva’s lovely face continued to glow with her haughty
scorn.</p>

<p>“You seem to think that I am deserted by God and
man, and completely given over to you,” she cried.
“You are mistaken. God has not deserted me. And I
can assure you, Craven and Octavia Black, that before
many weeks—before many days perhaps—Lord Towyn
will trace me to this place and rescue me from your
hands.”</p>

<p>“Let him come!” sneered Craven Black. “Let him
come!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” mocked Octavia, “let him come!”</p>

<p>Lord Towyn broke from the grasp Sir Harold still
held upon him, and stalked into the chamber.</p>

<p>With a shriek of delight, loud and piercing, Neva flew
to his arms.</p>

<p>He held her clasped to his breast and backed toward
the door, coming to a halt, looking at Neva’s enemies
with stern, accusing eyes.</p>

<p>Craven Black, Octavia, Mrs. Artress and Celeste stared
at him appalled. Not one could speak, but Octavia’s
hand clutched at her chest with sudden frenzy.</p>

<p>“Lord Towyn!” gasped Mrs. Artress at last, faintly.</p>

<p>Craven Black broke forth into curses. His hand flew
to his breast pocket, but fell again, as the door pushed
open and Mr. Atkins and Ryan, the detective, entered
the room.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, the game is up!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said our young hero, “the game is up. You
have played a daring game, Craven Black, and you have
lost it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>Octavia gasped for breath. The bitterness of defeat
was almost more than she could bear. The sight of
Neva in the arms of her lover nearly goaded her to madness.</p>

<p>“Yes, the game is up,” she said hollowly, “I suppose
that you traced Craven here from Inverness; but how
did you get upon our trail? How did you happen at
Inverness? No matter. I do not care to know just yet.
You cannot prosecute us, Lord Towyn, if you care to
preserve your bride’s family name from scandal. I was
Sir Harold Wynde’s wife, and that fact must shield me
and my friends. You cannot take from me my jointure
of four thousand a year, and with that Craven and I need
not suffer, especially as we have the Wynde Heights estate.
The game is up, Lord Towyn, as you say, but we
are not discomforted nor overthrown. You will keep
silence for the sake of the family. Besides, you know I
am Neva’s personal guardian, and had a right to take
her where I please.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” said the young earl sternly.
“Neva, darling, look up. I have news for you.”</p>

<p>Neva slowly lifted her pale, joyous face from her
lover’s bosom, and stood a little way from him, eager,
expectant, and wondering.</p>

<p>“My poor little girl!” said the young earl, with an infinite
yearning. “How you have suffered! I have brought
you very startling news, and you will need all your
bravery to bear it. Give me your hands—so! Neva, I
have news from India.”</p>

<p>Something in his tone startled the girl. Her face grew
paler on the instant.</p>

<p>“Yes, Arthur,” she said softly. “You have heard
more about his death—poor papa!”</p>

<p>“A gentleman has come from India,” said the earl
telling the story much as Atkins had told it to him. <a id="Ref_246" href="#BRef_246">“He</a><span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
says—can you bear to hear it, darling—he says that Sir
Harold did not die out there at all: that he was attacked
by a tiger, but was rescued by his Hindoo servant, who
sent him away into the mountains in the care of other
Hindoos, who kept Sir Harold a captive. And he says
that Sir Harold is alive and well to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, Arthur! Can it be?” cried Neva, trembling.
“My poor father! I dreamed that he still lived,
and my dream has come true. We will start for India at
once, and rescue papa. Oh, Arthur, do you think it is
true!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling, I believe it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t!” sneered Craven Black, turning pale
nevertheless. “Such trumpery tales are common enough.
Look at Livingstone. He’s been said to be dead these
several years, but every little while the newspapers resurrect
him. I <em>know</em> Sir Harold is dead!”</p>

<p>“And I know it,” scoffed Octavia. “Alive, after an
absence of so long duration! Bah! I wonder you haven’t
more sense, Lord Towyn. Sir Harold Wynde alive! I
should like to see him!”</p>

<p>The door swung slowly on its hinges, and Sir Harold
Wynde walked into the room. He paused near the
door, and surveyed his false wife with stern and awful
eyes.</p>

<p>Octavia gave utterance to a frightful scream—whose
horror was indescribable—and bounded forward, her
hand upon her breast, and fell to the floor upon her
face.</p>

<p>Sir Harold’s awful gaze turned upon Craven Black,
and seemed to turn that individual to stone. It rested
upon Artress, and she cowered before it in terror. It
passed over the French woman, and fixed itself upon
Neva, softening and melting to almost more than human
tenderness and love, and then, with a great joy shining<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
in his keen blue eyes, he opened wide his arms. Neva
sprang forward, and was clasped close to his great heart.</p>

<p>The sacred joy of that reunion need not be dwelt
upon.</p>

<p>Presently, as Sir Harold was about to lead his daughter
from the room, his glance rested upon the still prostrate
figure of Octavia.</p>

<p>“Look to your wife, Mr. Black,” he said; his irony
arousing Black from his stupor. “She has fainted!”</p>

<p>Craven Black obeyed the voice of command, essaying
to lift the prostrate figure of Octavia, but with a cry of
horror he let it fall again, shouting hoarsely:</p>

<p>“She’s dead! Octavia is dead!”</p>

<p>It was true. The engorged lungs had ceased their
work. The heart had stopped its beating.</p>

<p>That night, the yacht and the sloop started upon their
return to Inverness. In the former were Craven Black,
dispirited and despairing; Mrs. Artress, full of bewailings
for the poverty into which she was now plunged;
the French maid; the dead body of the false Octavia;
and the three sailors in Black’s employ.</p>

<p>In the sloop were Neva and her friends.</p>

<p>The two vessels arrived safely at Inverness, and the remains
of Lady Wynde were consigned to the grave.
Craven Black did not wait to see the last rites performed
for her who had served his wicked purposes so faithfully
and so well, but, abandoning his cousin, put to sea in his
yacht with three sailors, not caring whither he went.</p>

<p>A week later, the wreck of the yacht was found upon
the north German coast, and four bodies were washed
ashore, two still living, two dead. And of the dead, one
was identified, from the papers on his person, as Craven
Black.</p>

<p>Sir Harold with his daughter and his friends returned
to Hawkhurst. The story of Sir Harold’s return to<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
England had preceded them, and from the moment that
the party alighted at the Canterbury station until after
their arrival at their own home, Sir Harold received one
continual ovation. The tenantry of Hawkhurst turned
out in a body to welcome home their beloved landlord.
The joy bells were rung in the little village of Wyndham,
and guns were fired. It was a day long to be
remembered throughout that part of Kent.</p>

<p>The shadow that had fallen on Sir Harold’s life when
he first learned the baseness of his second wife, was dispelled
by the tender love and attentions of Neva and
her young lover. The smiles came back to his lips and
the joy to his heart, and he learned the lesson that many
must learn, that life need not be all dark and desolate
because one friend of the many has proved false.</p>

<p>A few months later the joy bells rang again, and again
the tenantry of Sir Harold made merry. The occasion
was the marriage of the heiress of Hawkhurst to the
young Lord Towyn. It was a joyous bridal. Sir John
Freise and wife, and their seven daughters were there.
Mr. Atkins’ plain face beamed from the midst of the
throng. Rufus Black and his gipsy-faced young wife,
both happy and loving, had come down from Mount
street to grace the wedding, and no congratulations to
the young bridal pair were more sincere than those
uttered by Rufus.</p>

<p>At the wedding breakfast, while Neva, fair and proud,
and radiant as a star, sat beside her equally radiant
young bridegroom, Rufus Black found opportunity to
speak a word privately to the bride.</p>

<p>“It has all ended as it ought to, Miss Neva—my lady,
I mean,” he whispered joyously. “Your father has got
over his disappointment and grief, and looks like a king,
as he stands yonder. I am getting to be a <em>man</em>—an
honest, upright, strong-souled man, with genuine backbone<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
and downright vim. Lally believes in me, you see,
and upholds me, God bless her. And you and the earl
are as happy as angels, Miss Ne—my lady, and you
deserve to be. Mrs. Artress is a governess—where do
you think—oh, divine justice—in the house of the
Blights at Canterbury! What worse could we wish her?
Our enemies—they were mine as well as yours, Lady
Towyn—played a daring game, and they lost it!”</p>

<p>of public taste in literature shows an overwhelming
preference for fiction.</p>

<p>Our mode of living is very complex. The
average business man and woman and the house-wife
have a lot to be troubled about these days,
so that the turning to good fiction as an escape
from daily cares is perfectly natural. This explains
in part why the S. &amp; S. novels are so popular.
The rest of the reason is that they are
mighty good stories at mighty low prices.</p>

<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">A Big Customer</p>

<p>The American reading public is the biggest
and only customer we have for the S. &amp; S. novels.
It’s a good-natured, clean-minded customer,
too. That’s why the demand for our books is so
phenomenal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Medal Library</span> contains over five hundred
different books by authors who know how to
write stories exactly suited to the wants of the
American reading public.</p>

<p>The quality of the stories, however, is
not to be judged by the low price.</p>

<p>Ask your news dealer to show you some <span class="smcap">Medal
Library</span> books, especially those by Edward C.
Taylor and Maxwell Stevens.</p>

<p>If the above are ordered from the publishers,
4c. must be added to the retail price of each copy
to cover postage.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont center">Seek the Superwoman</p>

<p>You will find her in almost every generation, in almost every
country, in almost every city. She is not a typical adventuress,
she is not a genius. The reason for her strong power is occult.
The nameless charm is found as often in homely, clumsy, dull,
old masculine women as in the reverse of these types.</p>

<p class="xlargefont boldfont center">What Makes a Superwoman?</p>

<p>If you think the problem worth while, why not try to solve it
by reading Albert Payson Terhune’s great book, SUPERWOMEN?
From Cleopatra to Lady Hamilton—they are mighty
interesting characters. Some of them smashed thrones, some
of them were content with wholesale heart smashing. You
will know their secret, or rather their secrets, for seldom did
two of them follow the same plan of campaign.</p>

<p>We have prepared a very handsome, special, limited edition
of the book, worthy of a place on your “best book” shelf. If
you subscribe to AINSLEE’S MAGAZINE now you can purchase
it for 50c. Send us a money order for $2.50 and receive
SUPERWOMEN postpaid, and, in addition, over 1900 pages of
splendid fiction throughout the coming year. AINSLEE’S
MAGAZINE is the best and smartest purely fiction magazine
published. You cannot invest $2.50 in reading matter to better
advantage than by availing yourself of this offer. Send check
or money order or, if you remit in cash, do not fail to register
the envelope. Act now!</p>

<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">History of the<br />
World War</p>

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont"><em><span class="largefont">By</span> Thomas R. Best</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">The most portentous crisis in the history
of the human family has just passed.
The World War was conceived in greed
and will be consummated in justice. It will
prove a blessing to mankind, because it spells
emancipation to countless unborn generations
from enslaving political and social
evils. It is a big subject and one that will
be discussed in every household for many
years to come. Questions will arise that
only a clear, concise account of the war
in handy form can settle.</p>

<p>Therefore, we ask you to consider <cite><b>History
of the World War</b></cite> by Thomas R. Best
which has been written from the American
standpoint. It is purely history—not vituperation.
This volume has a chronology of
important events that will prove of inestimable
reference value.</p>

<p class="xxlargefont boldfont center" style="word-spacing:0.15em">A REQUEST</p>

<p>Conditions due to the war have made it very difficult
for us to keep in print all of the books listed in our
catalogues. We still have about fifteen hundred different
titles that we are in a position to supply. These
represent the best books in our line. We could not afford,
in the circumstances, to reprint any of the less
popular works.</p>

<p>We aim to keep in stock the works of such authors as
Bertha Clay, Charles Garvice, May Agnes Fleming,
Nicholas Carter, Mary J. Holmes, Mrs. Harriet Lewis,
Horatio Alger, and the other famous authors who are
represented in our line by ten or more titles. Therefore,
if your dealer cannot supply you with exactly the
book you want, you are almost sure to find in his stock
another title by the same author, which you have not
read.</p>

<p>It short, we are asking you to take what your dealer
can supply, rather than to insist upon just what you
want. You won’t lose anything by such substitution,
because the books by the authors named are very uniform
in quality.</p>

<p>In ordering Street &amp; Smith novels by mail, it is advisable
to make a choice of at least two titles for each
book wanted, so as to give us an opportunity to substitute
for titles that are now out of print.</p>
